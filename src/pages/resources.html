                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            Britain is a fantastic place to live: a modern, thriving society with a long and illustrious history.
                            Our people have been at the heart of the world’s political, scientific, industrial and cultural development.
                            We are proud of our record of welcoming new migrants who will add to the diversity and dynamism of our national life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Applying to become a permanent resident or citizen of the UK is an important decision and commitment.
                            You will be agreeing to accept the responsibilities which go with permanent residence and to respect the laws,
                            values and traditions of the UK. Good citizens are an asset to the UK. We welcome those seeking to make a positive
                            contribution to our society.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Passing the Life in the UK test is part of demonstrating that you are ready to become a permanent migrant to the UK.
                            This handbook is designed to support you in your preparation. It will help you to integrate into society and play a full
                            role in your local community. It will also help ensure that you a have a broad general knowledge of the culture,
                            laws and history of the UK.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The values and principles of the UK</h3>

                        <p>
                            British society is founded on fundamental values and principles which all those living in the UK should respect and support.
                            These values are reflected in the responsibilities, rights and privileges of being a British citizen or permanent resident of
                            the UK. They are based on history and traditions and are protected by law, customs and expectations. There is no place in
                            British society for extremism or intolerance.
                        </p>

                        <div class="informative">

                            <h3>The fundamental principles of British life include:</h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Democracy</li>
                                <li>The rule of law</li>
                                <li>Individual liberty</li>
                                <li>Tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs</li>
                                <li>Participation in community life.</li>
                            </ul>

                        </div>

                        <p>As part of the citizenship ceremony, new citizens pledge to uphold these values. The pledge is:</p>

                        <p class="oblique bold">
                            ‘I will give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect its rights and freedoms.
                            I will uphold its democratic values. I will observe its laws faithfully and
                            fulfil my duties and obligations as a British citizen.’
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Flowing from the fundamental principles are responsibilities and freedoms which are shared by all
                            those living in the UK and which we expect all residents to respect.
                        </p>

                        <div class="informative">
                            <h3>If you wish to be a permanent resident or citizen of the UK, you should:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Respect and obey the law</li>
                                <li>Respect the rights of others, including their right to their own opinions</li>
                                <li>Treat others with fairness</li>
                                <li>Look after yourself and your family</li>
                                <li>Look after the area in which you live and the environment.</li>

                        </div>

                        <div class="informative">

                            <h3>In return, the UK offers:</h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Freedom of belief and religion</li>
                                <li>Freedom of speech</li>

                                <li>A right to a fair trial</li>
                                <li>A right to join in the election of a government.</li>
                            </ul>

                        </div>

                        <h3>Becoming a permanent resident</h3>

                        <p>To apply to become a permanent resident or citizen of the UK, you will need to:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Speak and read English</li>
                            <li>Have a good understanding of life in the UK.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>There are currently (as of January 2013) two ways you can be tested on these requirements:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Take the Life in the UK test. The questions are written in a way that requires an understanding
                                of the English language at English for Speakers of other Languages (ESOL) Entry Level 3, so there is
                                no need to take a separate English language test. People here on work visas, including those on Tier 1
                                and Tier 2 of the points-based system, normally must pass the Life in the UK test to become permanent residents.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                    Pass an ESOL course in English with Citizenship. You will need to take this course if your standard of English is
                                below ESOL Entry Level 3. The course will help you to improve your English and learn more about life in the UK. At the end
                                of the course you will take a test.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Once you have passed one of these tests, you can make an application for permanent residence or British citizenship.
                            The form that you have to complete and evidence that you need to provide will depend on your personal circumstances.
                            There is a fee for submitting an application, which is different for the various types of application. All of the forms
                            and a list of fees can be found on the UK Border Agency website, <a href="www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>From October 2013, the requirements will change. From that date, for settlement or permanent residence, you will need to:</p>

                        <div class="informative">

                            <ul>
                                <li>Pass the Life in the UK test</li>
                            </ul>

                        </div>

                        <p class="bold">AND</p>

                        <div class="informative">

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Produce acceptable evidence of speaking and listening skills in English at B1 of the
                                    Common European Framework of Reference.
                                    This is equivalent to ESOL Entry Level 3.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            The requirements for citizenship applications may also change in the future. Further details will be published on the UK Border Agency website and you
                            should check the information on that website for current requirements before applying for settlement or citizenship.
                        </p>

                            ALL parts of the handbook. The 24 questions will be different for each person taking the test at that test session.

                        <p>
                            The Life in the UK test is usually taken is English, although special arrangements can

                        <p>The UK is made up of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The rest of Ireland is an independent country.</p>

                            The official name of the country is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. ‘Great Britain’
                            refers only to England, Scotland and Wales, not to Northern Ireland. The words ‘Britain’, ‘British Isles’ or ‘British’,
                            however, are used in this book to refer to everyone in the UK.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are also several islands which are closely linked with the UK but are not part of it: the Channel Islands
                            and the Isle of Man. These have their own governments and are called ‘Crown dependencies’. There are also several
                            British overseas territories in other parts of the world, such as St Helena and the Falkland Islands. They are also
                            linked to the UK but are not part of it.

                        <p>
                            The UK is governed by the parliament sitting in Westminster. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also have
                            parliaments or assemblies of their own, with devolved powers in defined areas.

                        <h3>Early Britain</h3>

                        <p>
                            The first people to live in Britain were hunter-gatherers, in what we call the Stone Age.
                            For much of the Stone Age, Britain was connected to the continent by a land bridge. People came
                            and went, following the herds of deer and horses which they hunted. Britain only became permanently
                            separated from the continent by the Channel about 10,000 years ago.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The first farmers arrived in Britain 6,000 years ago. The ancestors of these first farmers probably
                            came from south-east Europe. These people built houses, tombs and monuments on the land. One of these
                            monuments, Stonehenge, still stands in what is now the English county of Wiltshire. Stonehenge was probably a
                            special gathering place for seasonal ceremonies. Other Stone Age sites have also survived. Skara Brae on Orkney,
                            off the north coast of Scotland, is the best preserved prehistoric village in northern Europe, and has helped
                            archaeologists to understand more about how people lived near the end of the Stone Age.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Around 4,000 years ago, people learned to make bronze. We call this period the Bronze Age. People
                            lived in roundhouses and buried their dead in tombs called round barrows. The people of the Bronze
                            Age were accomplished metalworkers who made many beautiful objects in bronze and gold, including
                            tools, ornaments and weapons. The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age, when people learned how to
                            make weapons and tools out of iron. People still lived in roundhouses grouped together into larger
                            settlements, and sometimes defended sites called hill forts. A very impressive hill fort can still
                            be seen today at Maiden Castle, in the English county of Dorset. Most people were farmers, craft
                            workers or warriors. The language they spoke was part of the Celtic language family. Similar languages
                            were spoken across Europe in the Iron Age and related languages are still spoken today in some parts of
                            Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The people of the Iron Age had a sophisticated culture and economy.
                            They made the first coins to be minted in Britain, some inscribed with the names of Iron Age kings.
                            This marks the beginnings of British history.

                        <h3>The Romans</h3>

                        <p>
                            Julius Caesar led a Roman invasion of Britain in 55 BC. This was unsuccessful and for nearly 100
                            years Britain remained separate from the Roman Empire. In AD 43 the Emperor Claudius led the Roman army
                            in a new invasion. This time, there was resistance from some of the British tribes but the Romans were successful
                            in occupying almost all of Britain. One of the tribal leaders who fought against the Romans was Boudicca, the queen
                            of the Iceni in what is now eastern England. She is still remembered today and there is a statue of her on
                            Westminster Bridge in London, near the Houses of Parliament.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Areas of what is now Scotland were never conquered by the Romans, and the Emperor Hadrian built a wall in the north
                            of England to keep out the Picts (ancestors of the Scottish people). Included in the wall were a number of forts.
                            Parts of Hadrian’s Wall, including the forts of Housesteads and Vindolanda, can still be seen. It is a popular area
                            for walkers and is a UNESCO (United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage Site.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Romans remained in Britain for 400 years. They built roads and public buildings, created a structure of law, and
                            introduced new plants and animals. It was during the 3rd and 4th centuries AD that the first Christian communities began to appear in Britain.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Anglo-Saxons</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Roman army left Britain in AD 410 to defend other parts of the Roman Empire and never returned. Britain was again invaded by
                            tribes from northern Europe: the Jutes, the Angles and the Saxons. The languages they spoke are the basis of modern-day English.
                            Battles were fought against these invaders but, by about AD 600, Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were established in Britain. These kingdoms
                            were mainly in what is now England. The burial place of one of the kings was at Sutton Hoo in modern Suffolk. This king was buried with
                            treasure and armour, all placed in a ship which was then covered by a mound of earth. Parts of the west of Britain, including much of what
                            is now Wales, and Scotland, remained free of Anglo-Saxon rule.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Anglo-Saxons were not Christians when they first came to Britain but, during this period, missionaries came to Britain to preach about
                            Christianity. Missionaries from Ireland spread the religion in the north. The most famous of these were St Patrick, who would become the
                            patron saint of Ireland, and St Columba, who founded a monastery on the island of Iona, off the coast of what is now Scotland. St Augustine
                            led missionaries from Rome, who spread Christianity in the south. St Augustine became the first Archbishop of Canterbury.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Vikings</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Vikings came from Denmark and Norway. They first visited Britain in AD 789 to raid coastal towns and take away goods and slaves.
                            Then, they began to stay and form their own communities in the east of England and Scotland. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in England united under
                            King Alfred the Great, who defeated the Vikings. Many of the Viking invaders stayed in Britain – especially in the east and north of England in
                            an area known as the Danelaw (many place names there, such as Grimsby and Scunthorpe come from the Viking languages). The Viking settlers mixed
                            with local communities and some converted to Christianity.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Anglo-Saxon kings continued to rule what is now England, except for a short period when there were Danish kings.
                            The first of these was Cnut, also named Canute.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the north, the threat of attack by Vikings had encouraged the people to unite under one king, Kenneth MacAlpin.
                            The term Scotland began to be used to describe that country.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Norman Conquest</h3>

                        <p>
                            In 1066, an invasion led by William, the Duke of Normandy (in what is now northern France), defeated Harold,
                            the Saxon king of England, at the Battle of Hastings. Harold was killed in the battle. William became king of
                            England and is known as William the Conqueror. The battle is commemorated in a great piece of embroidery, known
                            as the Bayeux tapestry, which can still be seen in France today.

                            The Norman Conquest was the last successful foreign invasion of England and led to many changes

                            class influenced the development of the English language as we know it today. Initially the
                            Normans also conquered Wales, but the Welsh gradually won territory back. The Scots and the
                            Normans fought on the border between England and Scotland; the Normans took over some land on
                            the border but did not invade Scotland.

                            William sent people all over England to draw up lists of all the towns and villages.
                            The people who lived there, who owned the land and what animals they owned were also
                            listed. This was called the Domesday Book. It still exists today and gives a picture
                            of society in England just after the Norman Conquest.

                        <h3>The Middle Ages</h3>

                        <h3>War at home and abroad</h3>

                        <p>
                            The period after the Norman Conquest up until about 1485 is called the Middle Ages
                            (or the medieval period). It was a time of almost constant war. The English kings
                            fought with the Welsh, Scottish and Irish noblemen for control of their lands.
                            In Wales, the English were able to establish their rule. In 1284 King Edward I of
                            England introduced the Statute of Rhuddlan, which annexed Wales to the Crown of
                            England. Huge castles, including Conwy and Caenarvon, were built to maintain
                            this power. By the middle of the 15th century the last Welsh rebellions had been
                            defeated. English laws and the English language were introduced.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Scotland, the English kings were less successful. In 1314 the Scottish,
                            led by Robert the Bruce, defeated the English at the Battle of Bannockburn,
                            and Scotland remained unconquered by the English.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the beginning of the Middle Ages, Ireland was an independent country. The
                            English first went to Ireland as troops to help the Irish king and remained to
                            build their own settlements. By 1200, the English ruled an area of Ireland known
                            as the Pale, around Dublin. Some of the important lords in other parts of Ireland
                            accepted the authority of the English king.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During the Middle Ages, the English kings also fought a number of wars abroad.
                            Many knights took part in the Crusades, in which European Christians fought for
                            control of the Holy Land. English kings also fought a long war with France, called
                            the Hundred Years War (even though it actually lasted 116 years). One of the most
                            famous battles of the Hundred Years War was the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, where
                            King Henry V’s vastly outnumbered English army defeated the French.
                            The English left France in the 1450s.

                        <h3>The Black Death</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Normans used a system of land ownership known as feudalism. The king gave land to his lords
                            in return for help in war. Landowners had to send certain numbers of men to serve in the army.
                            Some peasants had their own land but most were serfs. They had a small area of their lord’s
                            land where they could grow food. In return, they had to work for their lord and could not move
                            away. The same system developed in southern Scotland. In the north of Scotland and Ireland,
                            land was owned by members of the ‘clans’ (prominent families).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 1348, a disease, probably a form of plague, came to Britain. This was known as the Black Death.
                            One third of the population of England died and a similar proportion in Scotland and Wales. This was
                            one of the worst disasters ever to strike Britain. Following the Black Death, the smaller population
                            meant there was less need to grow cereal crops. There were labour shortages and peasants began to
                            demand higher wages. New social classes appeared, including owners of large areas of land (later called the gentry),
                            and people left the countryside to live in the towns. In the towns, growing wealth led to the development of a
                            strong middle class.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Ireland, the Black Death killed many in the Pale and, for a time, the area controlled by the English
                            became smaller.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Legal and political changes</h3>

                        <p>
                            In the Middle Ages, Parliament began to develop into the institution it is today. Its origins can be
                            traced to the king’s council of advisers, which included important noblemen and the leaders of the Church.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There were few formal limits to the king’s power until 1215. In that year, King John was forced
                            by his noblemen to agree to a number of demands. The result was a charter of rights called the
                            Magna Carta (which means the Great Charter). The Magna Carta established the idea that even the
                            king was subject to the law. It protected the rights of the nobility and restricted the king’s
                            power to collect taxes or to make and change laws. In future, the king would need to involve his
                            noblemen in decisions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In England, parliaments were called for the king to consult his nobles, particularly when the
                            king needed to raise money. The numbers attending Parliament increased and two separate parts,
                            known as Houses were established. This nobility, great landowners and bishops sat in the House
                            of Lords. Knights, who were usually smaller landowners, and wealthy people from towns and cities
                            were elected to sit in the House of Commons. Only a small part of the population was able to
                            join in electing the members of the Commons.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A similar Parliament developed in Scotland. It had three Houses, called Estates: the lords,
                            the commons and the clergy.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This was also a time of development in the legal system. The principle that judges are
                            independent of the government began to be established. In England, judges developed
                            ‘common law’ by a process of precedence (that is, following previous decisions) and
                            tradition. In Scotland, the legal system developed slightly differently and laws were
                            ‘codified’ (that is, written down).
                        </p>

                        <h3>A distinct identity</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Middle Ages saw the development of a national culture and identity. After the Norman Conquest,
                            the king and his noblemen had spoken Norman French and the peasants had continued to speak Anglo-Saxon.
                            Gradually these two languages combined to become one English language. Some words in modern English –
                            for example, ‘park’ and ‘beauty’ – are based on Norman French words. Other – for example, ‘apple’,
                            ‘cow’ and ‘summer’ – are based on Anglo-Saxon words. In modern English there are often two words
                            with very similar meanings, one from French and one from Anglo-Saxon. ‘Demand’ (French) and ‘ask’
                            (Anglo-Saxon) are examples. By 1400, in England, official documents were being written in English,
                            and English had become the preferred language of the royal court and Parliament.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the years leading up to 1400, Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a series of poems in English about a
                            group of people going to Canterbury on a pilgrimage. The people decided to tell each other stories
                            on the journey, and the poems describe the travellers and some of the stories they told. This
                            collection of poems is called The Canterbury Tales. It was one of the first books to be printed
                            by William Caxton, the first person in England to print books using a printing press. Many of the
                            stories are still popular. Some have been made into plays and television programmes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Scotland, many people continued to speak Gaelic and the Scots language also developed. A
                            number of poets began to write in the Scots language. One example is John Barbour, who wrote The
                            Bruce about the Battle of Bannockburn.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Middle Ages also saw a change in the type of buildings in Britain. Castles were built in many
                            places in Britain and Ireland, partly for defence. Today many are in ruins, although some, such as
                            Windsor and Edinburgh, are still in use. Great cathedrals – for example, Lincoln Cathedral –
                            were also built, and many of these are still used for worship. Several of the cathedrals had
                            windows of stained glass, telling stories about the Bible and Christian saints. The glass in
                            York Minster is a famous example.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During this period, England was an important trading nation. English wool became a very
                            important export. People came to England from abroad to trade and also to work. Many had
                            special skills, such as weavers from France, engineers from Germany, glass manufacturers
                            from Italy and canal builders from Holland.

                        <h3>The Wars of the Roses</h3>

                        <p>
                            In 1455, a civil war was begun to decide who should be king of England. It was
                            fought between the supporters of two families: the House of Lancaster and the House
                            of York. This war was called the Wars of the Roses, because the symbol of Lancaster was a
                            red rose and the symbol of York was a white rose. The wars ended with the Battle of Bosworth
                            Field in 1485. King Richard III of the House of York was killed in the battle and Henry Tudor,
                            the leader of the House of Lancaster, became King Henry VII. Henry then married King Richard’s
                            niece, Elizabeth of York, and united the two families. Henry was the first king of the House of
                            Tudor. The symbol of the House of Tudor was a red rose with a white rose inside it as a sign that
                            the Houses of York and Lancaster were now allies.

                            After his victory in the Wars of the Roses, Henry VII wanted to make sure
                            that England remained peaceful and that his position as king was secure.
                            He deliberately strengthened the central administration of England and reduced the
                            power of the nobles. He was thrifty and built up the monarchy’s financial reserves.
                            When he died, his son Henry VIII continued the policy of centralising power.

                        <h3>The six wives of Henry VIII</h3>

                        <p>
                            <span class="bold">Catherine of Aragon</span>
                            – Catherine was a Spanish princess. She and Henry had a number of children but only one, Mary, survived. When Catherine was too old to give him another child, Henry decided to divorce her, hoping that another wife would give him a son to be his heir.

                        <p>
                            <span class="bold">Anne Boleyn</span>
                            – Anne Boleyn was English. She and Henry had one daughter, Elizabeth. Anne was unpopular in the country and was accused of taking lovers. She was executed at the tower of London.

                            – Henry married Jane after Anne’s execution. She gave Henry the son he wanted, Edward, but she died shortly after his birth.

                            – Anne was a German princess. Henry married her for political reasons but divorced her soon after.

                            – Catherine was a cousin of Anne Boleyn. She was also accused of taking lovers and executed.
                        </p>

                            – Catherine was a widow who married Henry later in his life. She survived him and married again but died soon after.

                        <p>
                            To divorce his first wife, Henry needed the approval of the Pope. When the Pope refused, Henry established
                            the church of England. In this new church, the king, not the Pope, would have the power to appoint bishops
                            and order how people should worship.

                            At the same time the Reformation was happening across Europe. This was a movement against the authority
                            of the Pope and the ideas and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. The  Protestants formed their own
                            churches. They read the Bible in their own languages instead of Latin; they did not pray to saints or
                            at shrines; and they believed that a person’s own relationship with God was more important than
                            submitting to the authority of the Church. Protestant ideas gradually gained strength in England,
                            Wales and Scotland during the 16th century.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Ireland, however, attempts by the English to impose Protestantism (alongside efforts to introduce
                            the English system of laws about the inheritance of land) led to rebellion from the Irish chieftains,
                            and much brutal fighting followed.

                            During the reign of Henry VIII, Wales became formally united with England by the Act for the Government
                            of Wales. The Welsh sent representatives to the House of Commons and the Welsh legal system was reformed.

                        <p>
                            Henry VIII was succeeded by his son Edward VI, who was strongly Protestant. During his reign, the Book
                            of Common Prayer was written to be used in the Church of England. A version of this book is still used
                            in some churches today. Edward died at the age of 15 after ruling for just over six years, and his
                            half-sister Mary became queen. Mary was a devout Catholic and persecuted Protestants (for this reason,
                            she became known as ‘Bloody Mary’). Mary also died after a short reign and the next monarch was her
                            half-sister, Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.

                        <h3>Queen Elizabeth I</h3>

                        <p>
                            Elizabeth I was the younger daughter of Henry VIII. Queen Elizabeth I was a Protestant. She re-established
                            the Church of England as the official Church of England. Everyone had to attend their local church
                            and there were laws about the type of religious services and the prayers which could be said,
                            but Elizabeth did not ask about people’s real beliefs. She succeeded in finding a balance between
                            the views of the Catholics and the more extreme Protestants. In this way, she avoided any serious
                            religious conflict within England. Elizabeth became one of the most popular monarchs in English
                            history, particularly after 1588, when the English defeated the Spanish Armada (a large fleet of
                            ships), which had been sent by Spain to conquer England and restore Catholicism.

                        <h3>The Reformation in Scotland and Mary, Queen of Scots</h3>

                        <p>
                            Scotland had also been strongly influenced by Protestant ideas. In 1560, the predominantly Protestant
                            Scottish Parliament abolished the authority of the Pope in Scotland and Roman Catholic religious
                            services became illegal. A Protestant Church of Scotland with an elected leadership was established
                            but, unlike in England, this was not a state Church.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The queen of Scotland, Mary Stuart (often now called ‘Mary, Queen of Scots’) was a Catholic.
                            She was only a week old when her father died and she became queen. Much of her childhood was
                            spent in France. When she returned to Scotland, she was the centre of a power struggle between
                            different groups. When her husband was murdered, Mary was suspected of involvement and fled to
                            England. She gave her throne to her Protestant son, James VI of Scotland. Mary was Elizabeth I’s
                            cousin and hoped that Elizabeth might help her, but Elizabeth suspected Mary of wanting to take over
                            the English throne, and kept her prisoner for 20 years. Mary was eventually executed, accused of
                            plotting against Elizabeth I.

                        <h3>Exploration, poetry and drama</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Elizabethan period in England was a time of growing patriotism: a feeling of pride in being
                            English, English explorers sought new trade routes and tried to expand British trade into the
                            Spanish colonies in the Americas. Sir Francis Drake, one of the commanders in the defeat of the
                            Spanish Armada, was one of the founders of England’s naval tradition. His ship, the Golden Hind,
                            was one of the first to sail right around (‘circumnavigate’) the world. In Elizabeth I’s
                            time, English settlers first began to colonise the eastern coast of America. This colonisation,
                            particularly by people who disagreed with the religious views of the next two kings, greatly
                            increased in the next century.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Elizabethan period is also remembered for the richness of its poetry and drama, especially
                            the plays and poems of William Shakespeare.
                        </p>

                        <h3>William Shakespeare (1564-1616)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. He was a playwright and actor and wrote many poems
                            and plays. His most famous plays include A Midsummer Night’s dream, Hamlet, Macbeth and Romeo and
                            Juliet. He also dramatised significant events from the past, but he did not focus solely on kings
                            and queens. He was one of the first to portray ordinary Englishmen and women. Shakespeare had a
                            great influence on the English language and invented many words that are still common today. Lines
                            from his plays and poems which are often still quoted include:

                            Many people regard Shakespeare as the greatest playwright of all time. His plays and poems are
                            still performed and studied in Britain and other  countries today. The Globe Theatre in
                            London is a modern copy of the theatres in which his plays were first performed.

                        <p>
                            Elizabeth I never married and so had no children of her own to inherit her throne. When
                            she died in 1603 her heir was her cousin James VI of Scotland. He became King James I of
                            England, Wales and Ireland but Scotland remained a separate country.

                            One achievement of King James’ reign was a new translation of the Bible into English.
                            This translation is known as the ‘King James Version’ or the ‘Authorised Version’.
                            It was not the first English Bible but is a version which continues to be used in
                            many Protestant churches today.

                        <h3>Ireland</h3>

                        <p>
                            During this period, Ireland was an almost completely Catholic country.
                            Henry VII and Henry VIII had extended English control outside the Pale and had
                            established English authority over the whole country. Henry VIII took the title ‘King of Ireland’.
                            English laws were introduced and local leaders were expected to follow the instructions of the
                            Lord Lieutenants in Dublin.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I, many people in Ireland opposed rule by the Protestant
                            government in England. There were a number of rebellions. The English government encouraged Scottish
                            and English Protestants to settle in Ulster, the northern province of Ireland, taking over the land
                            from Catholic landholders. These settlements were known as plantations. Many of the new settlers came
                            from south-west Scotland and other land was given to companies based in London. James later organised
                            similar plantations in several other parts of Ireland. This had serious longterm consequence for the
                            history of England, Scotland and Ireland.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The rise of Parliament</h3>

                        <p>
                            Elizabeth I was very skilled at managing Parliament. During her reign, she was successful in
                            balancing her wishes and views against those of the House of Lords and those of the House of
                            Commons, which was increasingly Protestant in its views.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            James I and his son Charles I were less skilled politically. Both believed in the ‘Divine Right of Kings’:
                            the idea that the king was directly appointed by God to rule. They thought that the king should be
                            able to act without having to seek approval from Parliament. When Charles I inherited the thrones
                            of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland, he tried to rule in line with this principle. When he
                            could not get Parliament to agree with his religious and foreign policies, he tried to rule without
                            the Parliament at all. For 11 years, he found ways in which to raise money without Parliament’s
                            approval but eventually trouble in Scotland meant that he had to recall Parliament.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The beginning of the English Civil War</h3>

                        <p>
                            Charles I wanted the worship of the Church of England to include more ceremony and introduced a
                            revised Prayer Book. He tried to impose this Prayer Book on the Presbyterian Church in Scotland
                            and this led to serious unrest. A Scottish army was formed and Charles could not find the money he
                            needed for his own army without the help of Parliament. In 1640, he recalled Parliament to ask it
                            for funds. Many in Parliament were Puritans, a group of Protestants who advocated strict and simple
                            religious doctrine and worship. They did not agree with the king’s religious views and disliked his
                            reforms of the Church of England. Parliament refused to give the king the money he asked for, even
                            after the Scottish army invaded England.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another rebellion began in Ireland because the Roman Catholics in Ireland were afraid of the
                            growing power of the Puritans. Parliament took this opportunity to demand control of the
                            English army – a change that would have transferred substantial power from the king to
                            Parliament. In response, Charles I entered the House of Commons and tried to arrest five
                            parliamentary leaders, but they had been warned and were not there. (No monarch has set
                            foot in the Commons since.) Civil war between the king and Parliament could not now be
                            avoided and began in 1642. The country split into those who supported the king (the Cavaliers)
                            and those who supported Parliament (the Roundheads).

                            The king’s army was defeated at the Battles of Marston Moor and Naseby. By 1646, it was clear that the Parliament
                            had won the war. Charles was held prisoner by the parliamentary army. He was still unwilling to reach any
                            agreement with the Parliament and in 1649 he was executed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            England declared itself a republic, called the Commonwealth. It no longer had a monarch. For a time,
                            it was not totally clear how the country would be governed. For now, the army was in control. One of
                            its generals, Oliver Cromwell, was sent to Ireland, where the revolt which had begun in 1641 still
                            continued and where there was still a Royalist army. Cromwell was successful in establishing the
                            authority of the English Parliament but did this with such violence that even today Cromwell remains
                            a controversial figure in Ireland.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Scots had not agreed to the execution of Charles I and declared his sonCharles II to be king.
                            He was crowned king of Scotland and led a Scottish army into England. Cromwell defeated this army in
                            the Battles of Dunbar and Worcester. Charles II escaped from Worcester, famously hiding in an oak tree
                            on one occasion, and eventually fled to Europe. Parliament now controlled Scotland as well as England and Wales.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After his campaign in Ireland and victory over Charles II at Worcester, Cromwell was recognised as the
                            leader of the new republic. He was given the title of Lord Protector and ruled until his death in 1658.
                            When Cromwell died, his son, Richard, became Lord Protector in his place but was not able to control the
                            army or the government. Although Britain had been a republic for 11 years, without Oliver Cromwell there
                            was no clear leader or system of government. Many people in the country wanted stability. People began to
                            talk about the need for a king.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Restoration</h3>

                        <p>
                            In May 1660, Parliament invited Charles II to come back from exile in The Netherlands. He was
                            crowned King Charles II of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Charles II made it clear that
                            he had ‘no wish to go on his travels again’. He understood that he could not always do as he
                            wished but would sometimes need to reach agreement with the Parliament. Generally, Parliament
                            supported his policies. The Church of England again became the established official Church. Both
                            Roman Catholics and Puritans were kept out of power.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During Charles II’s reign, in 1665, there was a major outbreak of plague in London. Thousands of
                            people died, especially in poorer areas. The following year, a great fire destroyed much of the
                            city, including many churches and St Paul’s Cathedral. London was rebuilt with a new St Paul’s,
                            which was designed by a famous architect, Sir Christopher Wren. Samuel Pepys wrote about these
                            events in a diary which was later published and is still read today.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Habeas Corpus Act became law in 1679. This was a very important piece of legislation which
                            remains relevant today. Habeas corpus is Latin for ‘you must present the person in court’. The Act
                            guaranteed that no one could be held prisoner unlawfully. Every prisoner has a right to a court hearing.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Charles II was interested in science. During his reign, the Royal Society was formed to promote
                            ‘natural knowledge’. This is the oldest surviving scientific society in the world. Among its early
                            members were Sir Edmund Halley who successfully predicted the return of the comet now called Halley’s
                            Comet, and Sir Isaac Newton.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Isaac Newton (1643-1727)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Born in Lincolnshire, eastern England, Isaac Newton first became interested in science
                            when he studied at Cambridge University. He became an important figure in the field.
                            His most famous published work was Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica
                            (‘Mathematical Principle of Natural Philosophy’), which showed how gravity applied
                            to the whole universe. Newton also discovered that white light is made up of the
                            colours of the rainbow. Many of his discoveries are still important for modern science.
                        </p>

                        <h3>A Catholic king</h3>

                        <p>
                            Charles II had no legitimate children. He died in 1685 and his brother, James, who was a
                            Roman Catholic, became King James II in England, Wales and Ireland and King James VII of Scotland.
                            James favoured Roman Catholics and allowed them to be army officers, which an Act of Parliament
                            had forbidden. He did not seek to reach agreements with Parliament and arrested some of the bishops
                            of the Church of England. People in England worried that James wanted to make England a Catholic
                            country once more. However, his heirs were his two daughters, who were both firmly Protestant,
                            and people thought that this meant there would soon be a Protestant monarch again. Then James’s
                            wife had a son. Suddenly, it seemed likely that the next monarch would not be a Protestant after all.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Glorious Revolution</h3>

                        <p>
                            James II’s elder daughter, Mary, was married to her cousin William of Orange,
                            the Protestant ruler of the Netherlands. In 1688, important Protestants in England asked William to
                            invade England and proclaim himself king. When William reached England, there was no resistance.
                            James fled to France and William took over the throne, becoming William III in England, Wales and
                            Ireland, and William II of Scotland. William ruled jointly with Mary. This event was later called
                            the ‘Glorious Revolution’ because there was no fighting in England and because it guaranteed the
                            power of Parliament, ending the threat of monarch ruling on his or her own as he or she wished.
                            James II wanted to regain the throne and invaded Ireland with the help of a French army. William
                            defeated James II at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland in 1690, an event which is still celebrated
                            by some in Northern Ireland today. William re-conquered Ireland and James fled back to France.
                            Many restrictions were placed on the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland and Irish Catholics were
                            unable to take part in the government.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There was also support for James in Scotland. An attempt at an armed rebellion in support of
                            James was quickly defeated at Killiecrankie. All Scottish clans were required formally to
                            accept William as king by taking an oath. The MacDonalds of Glencoe were late in taking an oath.
                            The memory of this massacre meant some Scots distrusted the new government.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some continued to believe that James was the rightful king, particularly in Scotland. Some
                            joined him in exile in France; others were secret supporters. James’ supporters became known as Jacobites.

                        <h3>Constitutional monarchy – the Bill of Rights</h3>

                        <p>
                            At the coronation of William and Mary, a Declaration of Rights was read.
                            This confirmed that the king would no longer be able to raise taxes and administer
                            justice without agreement from Parliament. The balance of power between monarch and
                            Parliament had now permanently changed. The Bill of Rights, 1689, confirmed the rights
                            of Parliament and the limits of the king’s power. Parliament took control of who could
                            be monarch and declared that the king or queen must be a Protestant. A new Parliament
                            had to be elected at least every three years (later this became seven years and now it
                            is five years). Every year the monarch had to ask Parliament to renew funding for the
                            army and the navy.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These changes meant that, to be able to govern effectively, the monarch needed to
                            have advisers, or ministers, who would be able to ensure a majority of votes in
                            the House of Commons and the House of Lords. There were two main groups in Parliament,
                            known as the Whigs and the Tories. (The modern Conservative Party is still sometimes
                            referred to as the Tories.) This was the beginning of party politics.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This was also an important time for the development of a free press (newspapers and other
                            publications which are not controlled by the government). From 1695, newspapers were allowed
                            to operate without a government licence. Increasing numbers of newspapers began to be published.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The laws passed after the Glorious Revolution are the beginning of what is called
                            ‘constitutional monarchy’. The monarch remained very important but was no longer
                            able to insist on particular policies or actions if Parliament did not agree.
                            After William III, the ministers gradually became more important than the monarch
                            but this was not a democracy in the modern sense. The number of people who had the
                            right to vote for members of Parliament was still very small. Only men who owned
                            property of a certain value were able to vote. No women at all had the vote.
                            Some constituencies were controlled by a single wealthy family. They were called
                            the ‘pocket boroughs’. Other constituencies had hardly any
                            voters and were called ‘rotten boroughs’.
                        </p>

                        <h3>A growing population</h3>

                        <p>
                            This was a time when many people left Britain and Ireland to settle in new colonies
                            in America and elsewhere, but others came to live in Britain. The first Jews to come
                            to Britain since the Middle Ages settled in London in 1656. Between 1680 and 1720 many
                            refugees called Huguenots came from France. They were Protestants and had been persecuted
                            for their religion. Many were educated and skilled and worked as scientists, in banking,
                            or in weaving or other crafts.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Act or Treaty of Union in Scotland</h3>

                        <p>
                            William and Mary’s successor, Queen Anne, had no surviving children. This created uncertainty
                            over the succession in England, Wales and Ireland and in Scotland. The Act of Union, known as
                            the Treaty of Union in Scotland, was therefore agreed in 1707, creating the Kingdom of Great
                            Britain. Although Scotland was no longer an independent country, it kept its own legal and
                            education systems and Presbyterian Church.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Prime Minister</h3>

                        <p>
                            When Queen Anne died in 1714, Parliament chose a German, George I, to be the next king,
                            because he was Anne’s nearest Protestant relative. An attempt by Scottish Jacobites to
                            put James II’s son on the throne instead was quickly defeated. George I did not speak
                            very good English and this increased his need to rely on his ministers. The most
                            important minister in Parliament became known as the Prime Minister. The first man
                            to be called this was Sir Robert Walpole, who was Prime Minister from 1721 to 1742.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The rebellion of the clans</h3>

                        <p>
                            In 1745 there was another attempt to put a Stuart king back on the throne in place of
                            George I’s son, George II. Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie),
                            the grandson of James II, landed in Scotland. He was supported by clansmen
                            from the Scottish highlands and raised and army. Charles initially had some
                            successes but was defeated by George II’s army at the Battle of Culloden in 1746.
                            Charles escaped back to Europe.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The clans lost a lot of their power and influence after Culloden. Chieftains became
                            landlords if they had the favour of the English king, and clansmen became tenants who
                            had to pay for the land they used.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A process began which became known as the ‘Highland Clearances’. Many Scottish
                            landlords destroyed individual small farms (known as ‘crofts’) to make space for
                            large flocks of sheep and cattle. Evictions became very common in the early 19th
                            century. Many Scottish people left for North America at this time.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Robert Burns (1759-96)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Known in Scotland as ‘The Bard’, Robert Burns was a Scottish poet. He wrote in the Scots language,
                            English with some Scottish words and standard English. He also revised a lot of the
                            traditional folk songs by changing or adding lyrics. Burns’ best-known work is
                            probably the song Auld Lang Syne, which is sung by people in the UK and other
                            countries when they are celebrating the New Year (or Hogmanay as it is called in Scotland).

                        <h3>The Enlightenment</h3>

                        <p>
                            During the 18th century, new ideas about politics, philosophy and science were developed.
                            This is often called ‘the Enlightenment’. Many of the great thinkers of the Enlightenment
                            were Scottish. Adam Smith developed ideas about economics which are still referred to today.
                            David Hume’s ideas about human nature continue to influence philosophers. Scientific discoveries,
                            such as James Watt’s work on steam power, helped the progress of the Industrial Revolution.
                            One of the most important principles of the Enlightenment was that everyone should have the
                            right to their own political and religious beliefs and that the state should not try to dictate
                            to them. This continues to be an important principle in the UK today.

                        <h3>The Industrial Revolution</h3>

                        <p>
                            Before the 18th century, agriculture was the biggest source of employment in Britain.
                            There were many cottage industries, where people worked from home to produce goods such as cloth and lace.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Industrial Revolution was the rapid development of industry in Britain in the 18th
                            and 19th centuries. Britain was the first country to industrialise on a large scale.
                            It happened because of the development of machinery and the use of steam power.
                            Agriculture and the manufacturing of goods became mechanised. This made things more
                            efficient and increased production. Coal and other raw materials were needed to power
                            the new factories. Many people moved from the countryside and started working in the
                            mining and manufacturing industries.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The development of the Bessemer process for the mass production of steel led to the
                            development of the shipbuilding industry and the railways. Manufacturing jobs
                            became the main source of employment in Britain.

                        <h3>Richard Arkwright (1732-92)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Born in 1732, Arkwright originally trained and worked as a barber. He was able to
                            dye hair and make wigs. When wigs became less popular, he started to work in textiles.
                            He improved the original carding machine. Carding is the process of preparing fibres
                            for spinning into yarn and fabric. He also developed horse-driven spinning mills that
                            used only one machine. This increased the efficiency of production. Later, he used
                            the steam engine to power machinery. Arkwright is particularly remembered for the
                            efficient and profitable way that he ran his factories.

                        <p>
                            Better transport links were needed to transport raw materials and manufactured goods.
                            Canals were built to link the factories to towns and cities and to the ports,
                            particularly in the new industrial areas in the middle and north of England.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Working conditions during the Industrial Revolution were very poor. There were no
                            laws to protect employees, who were often forced to work long hours in dangerous
                            situations. Children also worked and were treated in the same way as adults.
                            Sometimes they were treated even more harshly.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This was also a time of increased colonisation overseas. Captain James Cook
                            mapped the coast of Australia and a few colonies were established there.
                            Britain gained control over Canada, and the East India Company, originally
                            set up to trade, gained control of large parts of India. Colonies began to
                            be established in southern Africa.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Britain traded all over the world and began to import more goods. Sugar and
                            tobacco came from North America and the west Indies; textiles, tea and spices
                            came from India and the area that is today called Indonesia. Trading and
                            settlements overseas sometimes brought Britain into conflict with other countries,
                            particularly France, which was expanding and trading in a similar way in many of
                            the same areas of the world.

                        <h3>Sake Dean Mahomet (1759-1851)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Mahomet was born is 1759 and grew up in the Bengal region of India. He served in the
                            Bengal army and came to Britain in 1782. He then moved to Ireland and eloped with an
                            Irish girl called Jane Daly in 1786, returning to England at the turn of the century.
                            In 1810 he opened the Hindoostane Coffee House in George Street, London. It was the
                            first curry house to open in Britain. Mahomet and his wife also introduced ‘shampooing’,
                            the Indian art of head massage, to Britain.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The slave trade</h3>

                        <p>
                            This commercial expansion and prosperity was sustained in part by the booming slave trade.
                            While slavery was illegal within Britain itself, by the 18th century it was a fully
                            established overseas industry, dominated by  Britain and the American colonies.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Slaves came primarily from West Africa. Travelling on British ships in horrible conditions,
                            they were taken to America and the Caribbean, where they were made to work on tobacco and
                            sugar plantations. The living and working conditions for slaves were very bad. Many slaves
                            tried to escape and others revolted against their owners in protest at their terrible treatment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There were, however people in Britain who opposed the slave trade. The first formal anti-slavery
                            groups were set up by the Quakers in the late 1700s, and they petitioned Parliament to ban the
                            practice. William Wilberforce, an evangelical Christian and a member of Parliament, also played
                            an important part in changing the law. Along with other abolitionists (people who supported the
                            abolition of slavery), he succeeded in turning public opinion against the slave trade. In 1807,
                            it became illegal to trade slaves in British ships or from British ports, and in 1833 the
                            Emancipation Act abolished slavery throughout the British Empire. The Royal Navy stopped
                            slave ships from other countries, freed the slaves and punished the slave traders.
                            After 1833, 2 million Indian and Chinese workers were employed to replace the freed
                            slaves. They worked on sugar plantations in the Caribbean, in mines in South Africa,
                            on railways in East Africa and in the army in Kenya.

                        <h3>The American War of Independence</h3>

                        <p>
                            By the 1760s, there were substantial British colonies in North America.
                            The colonies were wealthy and largely in control of their own affairs. Many of
                            the colonist families had originally gone to North America in order to have religious
                            freedom. They were well educated and interested in ideas of liberty.
                            The British government wanted to tax the colonies. The colonists saw this as an
                            attack on their freedom and said there should be ‘no taxation without representation’
                            in the British Parliament. Parliament tried to compromise by repealing some of the taxes,
                            but relationships between the British government and the colonies continued to worsen.
                            Fighting broke out between the colonists and the British forces. In 1776, 13 American
                            colonies declared their independence, stating that people had a right to establish their
                            own governments. The colonists eventually defeated the British army and Britain recognised
                            the colonies’ independence in 1783.

                        <h3>War with France</h3>

                        <p>
                            During the 18th century, Britain fought a number of wars with France. In 1789,
                            there was a revolution in France and the new French government soon declared war on
                            Britain. Napoleon, who became Emperor of France, continued the war. Britain’s
                            navy fought against combined French and Spanish fleets, winning the Battle of
                            Trafalgar in 1805. Admiral Nelson was in charge of the British fleet at Trafalgar and
                            was killed in the battle. Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square, London, is a monument
                            to him. His ship, HMS Victory, can be visited in Portsmouth. The British army also fought
                            against the French. In 1815, the French Wars ended with the defeat of the Emperor
                            Napoleon by the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo. Wellington was known as
                            the Iron Duke and later became Prime Minister.

                            The Battle of Trafalgar (21 October 1805) was a naval engagement fought by the
                            British Royal Navy against the combined fleets of the French Navy and Spanish Navy.

                        <h3>The Union Flag</h3>

                        <p>
                            Although Ireland had had the same monarch as England and Wales since Henry VIII,
                            it had remained a separate country. In 1801, Ireland became unified with England,
                            Scotland and Wales after the Act of Union of 1800. This created the United Kingdom of
                            Great Britain and Ireland. One symbol of this union between England, Scotland, Wales
                            and Ireland was a new version of the official flag, the Union Flag. This is still
                            used today as the official flag of the UK.
                        </p>

                        <div class="informative">

                            <h3>The Union Flag consists of three crosses:</h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The cross of St George, patron saint of England, is a red cross on a white ground.</li>
                                <li>The cross of St Andrew, patron saint of Scotland, is a diagonal white cross on a blue ground.</li>
                                <li>The cross of St Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, is a diagonal red cross on a white ground.</li>
                            </ul>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            The Union Flag is also known as the Union Jack. The crosses of the three countries combined
                            form the Union Flag.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There is also an official Welsh flag, which shows a Welsh dragon. The Welsh dragon does
                            not appear on the Union Flag because, when the first Union Flag was created in 1606 from
                            the flags of Scotland and England, the Principality of Wales was already united with England.

                        <h3>The Victorian Age</h3>

                        <p>
                            In 1837, Queen Victoria became queen of the UK at the age of 18. She reigned until 1901,
                            almost 64 years. At the date of writing (2013) this is the longest reign of any
                            British monarch. Her reign is known as the Victorian Age. It was a time when Britain
                            increased in power and influence abroad. Within the UK, the middle classes became
                            increasingly significant and a number of reformers led moves to improve conditions of life for the poor.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The British Empire</h3>

                        <p>
                            During the Victorian period, the British Empire grew to cover all of India, Australia and large
                            parts of Africa. It became the largest empire the world has ever seen, with an
                            estimated population of more than 400 million people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many people were encouraged to leave the UK to settle overseas. Between 1853 and 1913,
                            as many as 13 million British citizens left the country. People continued to come to
                            Britain from other parts of the world. For example, between 1870 and 1914, around
                            120,000 Russian and Polish Jews came to Britain to escape persecution. Many settled in
                            London’s East End and in Manchester and Leeds. People from the Empire, including
                            India and Africa, also came to Britain to live, work and study.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Trade and industry</h3>

                        <p>
                            Britain continued to be a great trading nation. The government began to promote policies of
                            free trade, abolishing a number of taxes on imported goods. One example of this was
                            the repealing of the Corn Laws in 1846. These had prevented the import of cheap grain.
                            The reforms helped the development of the British industry, because raw materials
                            could now be imported cheaply.
                        </p>

                            Working conditions in factories gradually became better. In 1847, the number of hours
                            that women and children could work was limited by law to 10 hours per day. Better
                            housing began to be built for workers.

                            Transport links also improved, enabling goods and people to move more easily around
                            the country. Just before Victoria came to the throne, the father and son George and Robert
                            Stephenson pioneered the railway engine and a major expansion of
                            the railways took place in the Victorian period. Railways were built
                            throughout the Empire. There were also great advances in other areas,
                            such as the building of bridges by engineers such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

                        <h3>Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806-59)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Brunel was originally from Portsmouth, England. He was an engineer who built tunnels, bridges,
                            railway lines and ships. He was responsible for constructing the Great Western Railway,
                            which was the first major railway built in Britain. It runs from Paddington Station in
                            London to the south west of England, the West Midlands and Wales. Many of Brunel’s bridges
                            are still in use today. The Clifton Suspension Bridge was designed by
                            Isambard Kingdom Brunel and is spanning the Avon Gorge.

                            British industry led the world in the 19th century. The UK produced more that
                            half of the world’s iron, coal and cotton cloth. The UK also became a centre
                            for financial services, including insurance and banking. In 1851, the Great
                            Exhibition opened in Hyde Park in the Crystal Palace, a huge building made
                            of steel and glass. Exhibits ranged from huge machines to handmade goods.
                            Countries from all over the world showed their goods but most of the objects were made in Britain.

                        <h3>The Crimean War</h3>

                        <p>
                            From 1853 to 1856, Britain fought with Turkey and France against Russia in the Crimean War.
                            It was the first war to be extensively covered by the media through news stories and photographs.
                            The conditions were very poor  and many soldiers died from illnesses they caught in the hospitals,
                            rather than from war wounds. Queen Victoria introduced the Victoria Cross medal during this war.
                            It honours acts of valour by soldiers.

                        <h3>Florence Nightingale (1820-1910)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Florence Nightingale was born in Italy to English parents. At the age of 31, she trained as a nurse in
                            Germany. In 1854, she went to Turkey and worked in military hospitals, treating soldiers who were
                            fighting in the Crimean War. She and her fellow nurses improved the conditions in the hospital and
                            reduced the mortality rate. In 1860 she established the Nightingale Training School for nurses at
                            St Thomas’ Hospital in London. The school was the first of its kind and still exists today, as do
                            many of the practices that Florence used. She is often regarded as the founder of modern nursing.

                        <h3>Ireland in the 19th century</h3>

                        <p>
                            Conditions in Ireland were not as good as in the rest of the UK. Two-thirds of the population
                            still depended on farming to make their living, often on very small plots of land.
                            In the middle of the century the potato crop failed, and Ireland suffered a famine.
                            A million people died from disease and starvation. Another million and a half left
                            Ireland. Some emigrated to the United States and others came to England.
                            By 1861 there were large populations of Irish people in cities such as Liverpool,
                            London, Manchester and Glasgow.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Irish Nationalist movement had grown strongly through the 19th century.
                            Some, such as the Fenians, favoured complete independence. Others, such as
                            Charles Stuart Parnell, advocated ‘Home Rule’, in which Ireland would
                            remain in the UK but have its own parliament.

                        <h3>The right to vote</h3>

                        <p>
                            As the middle classes in the wealthy industrial towns and cities grew in influence,
                            they began to  demand more political power. The Reform Act of 1832 had greatly
                            increased the number of people with the right to vote. The act also abolished
                            the old pocket and rotten boroughs and more parliamentary seats were given to
                            the towns and cities. There was a permanent shift of political power from the
                            countryside to the towns but voting was still based on ownership of the property.
                            This meant that members of the working class were still unable to vote.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A movement began to demand the vote for the working classes and other people
                            without property. Campaigners, called the Chartists, presented petitions to
                            Parliament. At first they seemed to be unsuccessful, but in 1867 there was
                            another Reform Act. This created many more urban seats in Parliament and
                            reduced the amount of property that people needed to have before they could
                            vote. However, the majority of men still did not have the right to
                            vote and no women could vote.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Politicians realised that the increased number of voters meant that
                            they needed to persuade people to vote for them if they were to be
                            sure of being elected to Parliament. The political parties began to
                            create organizations to reach out to ordinary voters. Universal suffrage
                            (the right of every adult, male or female, to vote) followed in the next century.

                        <p>
                            In common with the rest of Europe, women in 19th century Britain had
                            fewer rights than men. Until 1870, when a woman got married, her
                            earnings, property and money automatically belonged to her husband.
                            Acts of Parliament in 1870 and 1882 gave wives the right to keep their
                            own earnings and property. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
                            an increasing number of women campaigned and demonstrated for greater
                            rights and, in particular, the right to vote. They formed the women’s
                            suffrage movement and became known as the ‘suffragettes’.

                        <h3>Emmeline Pankhurst (1858-1928)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Emmeline Pankhurst was born in Manchester in 1858. She set up the
                            women’s Franchise League in 1889, which fought to get the vote in
                            local elections for married women. In 1903 she helped found the Women’s
                            Social and Political Union (WSPU). This was the first group whose members
                            were called ‘suffragettes’. The group used civil disobedience as part of
                            their protest to gain the vote for women. They chained themselves to railings,
                            smashed windows and committed arson. Many of the women, including Emmeline,
                            went on hunger strike. In 1918, women over the age of 30 were given voting rights
                            and the right to stand for Parliament, partly in recognition of the contribution
                            women made to the war effort during the First World War. Shortly before Emmeline’s
                            death in 1928, women were given the right to vote at the age of 21, the same as men.

                        <h3>The future of the Empire</h3>

                        <p>
                            Although the British Empire continued to grow until the 1920s,
                            there was already discussion in the late 19th century about
                            its future direction. Supporters of expansion believed that
                            the Empire benefited Britain through increased trade and commerce.
                            Others thought the Empire had become over-expanded and that the
                            frequent conflicts in many parts of the Empire, such as India’s
                            north-west frontier or southern Africa, were a drain on resources.
                            Yet the great majority of British people believed in the Empire as
                            a force for good in the world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Boer War of 1899 to 1902 made the discussions about the future of the Empire more urgent.
                            The British went to war in South Africa with settlers from the Netherlands called the Boers.
                            The Boers fought fiercely and the war went on for over three years. Many died in the
                            fighting and many more from disease. There was some public sympathy for the Boers and
                            people began to question whether the Empire could continue. As different parts of the
                            Empire developed, they won greater freedom and autonomy from Britain. Eventually, by
                            the second half of the 20th century, there was, for the most part, an orderly
                            transition from Empire to Commonwealth, with countries being granted their independence.

                        <p>
                            Rudyard Kipling was born in India in 1865 and later lived in India, the UK and the USA.
                            He wrote books and poems set in both India and the UK. His poems and novels reflected
                            the idea that the British Empire was a force for good. Kipling was awarded the Nobel
                            Prize in Literature in 1907. His books include the Just So Stories and The Jungle
                            Book, which continue to be popular today. His poem If has often been voted among the
                            UK’s favourite poems. It begins with these words:

                        <h3>The First World War</h3>

                        <p>
                            The early 20th century was a time of optimism in Britain. The nation, with its expansive
                            Empire, well-admired navy, thriving industry and strong political institutions,
                            was what is now known as a global ‘superpower’. It was also a time of social progress.
                            Financial help for the unemployed, old-age pensions and free school meals were just a
                            few of the important measures introduced. Various laws were passed to improve safety in
                            the workplace; town planning rules were tightened to prevent the further development of
                            slums; and better support was given to mothers and their children after divorce or
                            separation. Local government became more democratic and a salary for members of Parliament
                            (MPs) was introduced for the first time, making it easier for more people to take part in public life.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This era of optimism and progress was cut short when war broke out between several European
                            nations. On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated. This set off
                            a chain of events leading to the First World War (1914-18). But while the assassination
                            provided the trigger for war, other factors – such as a growing sense of nationalism in
                            many European states; increasing militarism; imperialism; and the division of the major
                            European powers into two camps – all set the conditions for war.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The conflict was centred in Europe, but it was a global war involving nations from around
                            the world. Britain was part of the Allied Powers, which included (amongst others) France,
                            Russia, Japan, Belgium, Serbia – and later, Greece, Italy, Romania and the United States.
                            The whole of the British Empire was involved in the conflict – for example, more than a
                            million Indians fought on behalf of Britain in lots of different countries, and around
                            40,000 were killed. Men from the West Indies, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Canada
                            also fought with the British. The Allies fought against the Central Powers – mainly Germany,
                            the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and later Bulgaria. Millions of people were
                            killed or wounded, with more than 2 million British casualties. One battle, the British
                            attack of the Somme in July 1916, resulted in about 60,000 British casualties on the
                            first day alone. The First World War ended at 11.00 am on 11th November 1918 with
                            victory for Britain and its allies.

                        <h3>The partition of Ireland</h3>

                        <p>
                            In 1913, the British government promised ‘Home Rule’ for Ireland. The proposal was to
                            have a self-governing Ireland with its own parliament but still part of the UK.
                            A Home Rule Bill was introduced in Parliament. It was opposed by the Protestants
                            in the north of Ireland, who threatened to resist Home Rule by force.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The outbreak of the First World War led the British government to postpone any
                            changes in Ireland. Irish Nationalists were not willing to wait and in 1916
                            there was an uprising (the Easter Rising) against the British in Dublin.
                            The leaders of the uprising were executed under military law. A guerrilla
                            war against the British army and the police in Ireland followed. In 1921 a
                            peace treaty was signed and in 1922 Ireland became two countries. The six
                            countries in the north which were mainly Protestant remained part of the UK
                            under the name Northern Ireland. The rest of Ireland became the Irish Free
                            State. It had its own government and became a republic in 1949.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There were people in both parts of Ireland who disagree with the split between the
                            North and the South. They still wanted Ireland to be one independent country. Years
                            of disagreement led to a terror campaign in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. The conflict
                            between those wishing for full Irish independence and those wishing to remain
                            loyal to the British government is often referred to as ‘the Troubles’.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The inter-war period</h3>

                        <p>
                            In the 1920s, many people’s living conditions got better.
                            There were improvements in public housing and new homes were built in many
                            towns and cities. However, in 1929, the world entered the ‘Great Depression’
                            and some parts of the UK suffered mass unemployment. The effects of the depression
                            of the 1930s were felt differently in different parts of the UK. The traditional
                            heavy industries such as shipbuilding were badly affected but new industries –
                            including the automobile and aviation industries – developed. As prices generally
                            fell, those in work had more money to spend. Car ownership doubled from 1 million to
                            2 million between 1930 and 1939. In addition, many new houses were built.
                            It was also a time of cultural blossoming, with writers such as Graham Greene
                            and Evelyn Waugh prominent. The economist John Maynard Keynes published
                            influential new theories of economics. The BBC started radio broadcasts in
                            1922 and began the world’s first regular television service in 1936.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Second World War</h3>

                        <p>
                            Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933. He believed that the conditions
                            imposed on Germany by the Allies after the First World War were unfair;
                            he also wanted to conquer more land for the German people. He set about
                            renegotiating treaties, building up arms, and testing Germany’s military
                            strength in nearby countries. The British government tried to avoid another
                            war. However, when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Britain and France declared war
                            in order to stop his aggression.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The war was initially fought between the Axis powers (fascist Germany and Italy
                            and the Empire of Japan) and the Allies. The main countries on the allied side
                            were the UK, France, Poland, Austria, New Zealand, Canada, and the Union of South Africa.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Having occupied Austria and invaded Czechoslovakia, Hitler followed his
                            invasion of Poland by taking control of Belgium and the Netherlands. Then,
                            in 1940, German forces defeated allied troops and advanced through France.
                            At this time of national crisis, Winston Churchill became Prime Minister
                            and Britain’s war leader.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Winston Churchill (1874-1965)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Churchill was the son of a politician and, before becoming a Conservative MP in 1900,
                            was a soldier and journalist. In May 1940 he became Prime Minister. He refused to
                            surrender to the Nazis and was an inspirational leader to the British people in a
                            time of hardship. He lost the General Election in 1945 but returned as Prime Minister in 1951.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            He was an MP until he stood down at the 1964 General Election. Following his death in
                            1965, he was given a state funeral. He remains a much-admired figure to this day, and
                            in 2002 was voted the greatest Briton of all time by the public. During the War,
                            he made many famous speeches including lines which you may still hear:

                            As France fell, the British decided to evacuate British and French soldiers from France in a
                            huge naval operation. Many civilian volunteers in small pleasure and fishing boats from Britain
                            helped the Navy to rescue more than 300,000 men from the beaches around Dunkirk. Although many
                            lives and a lot o equipment were lost, the evacuation was a success and meant that Britain was
                            better able to continue the fight against the Germans. The evacuation gave rise to the phrase ‘the Dunkirk spirit’.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            From the end of June 1940 until the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Britain
                            and the Empire stood almost alone against Nazi Germany.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Hitler wanted to invade Britain, but before sending in troops, Germany needed to control the
                            air campaign against Britain, but the British resisted with their fighter planes and eventually
                            won the crucial aerial battle against the Germans, called ‘the Battle of Britain’, in the summer
                            of 1940. The most important planes used by the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain were the
                            Spitfire and the Hurricane – which were designed and built in Britain. Despite this crucial
                            victory, the German air force was able to continue bombing London and other British cities at
                            night-time. This was called the Blitz. Coventry was almost totally destroyed and a great deal
                            of damage was done in other cities, especially in the East End of London. Despite the
                            destruction, there was a strong national spirit of resistance in the UK. The phrase
                            ‘the Blitz spirit’ is still used today to describe Britons pulling together in the face of adversity.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the same time as defending Britain, the British military was fighting the Axis on
                            many other fronts. In Singapore, the Japanese defeated the British and then occupied
                            Burma, threatening India. The United States entered the war when the Japanese bombed
                            its naval base at Pearl Harbor in December 1941.

                        <p>
                            That same year, Hitler attempted the largest invasion in history by attacking the
                            Soviet Union. It was a fierce conflict, with huge losses on both sides. German
                            forces were ultimately repelled by the Soviets, and the damage they sustained
                            proved to be a pivotal point in the war.

                        <p>
                            The allied forces gradually gained the upper hand, winning significant victories in
                            North Africa and Italy. German losses in the Soviet Union, combined with the support
                            of the Americans, meant that the Allies were eventually strong enough to attack Hitler’s
                            forces in Western Europe. On 6 June 1944, allied forces landed in Normandy
                            (this event is often referred to as ‘D-Day’). Following victory on the beaches
                            of Normandy, the allied forces pressed on through France and eventually into
                            Germany. The Allies comprehensively defeated Germany in May 1945.

                            The war against Japan ended in August 1945 when the United States dropped its
                            newly developed atom bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
                            Scientists led by Ernest Rutherford, working at Manchester and then
                            Cambridge University, were the first to ‘split the atom’ and took part
                            in the Manhattan Project in the United States, which developed the atomic bomb. The war was finally over.

                        <h3>Alexander Fleming (1881-1955)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Born in Scotland, Fleming moved to London as a teenager and later qualified as a
                            doctor. He was researching influenza (the ‘flu’) in 1928 when he discovered penicillin.
                            This was then further developed into a usable drug by the scientists Howard Florey
                            and Ernst Chain. By the 1940s it was in mass production. Fleming won the Nobel
                            Prize in Medicine in 1945. Penicillin is still used to treat bacterial infections today.

                        <h3>The welfare state</h3>

                        <p>
                            Although the UK had won the war, the country was exhausted economically and
                            the people wanted change. During the war, there had been significant reforms
                            to the educational system and people now looked for wider social reforms.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 1945 the British people elected a Labour government. The new Prime
                            Minister was Clement Attlee, who promised to introduce the welfare state
                            outlined in the Beveridge Report. In 1948, Aneurin (Nye) Bevan, the
                            Minister for Health, led the establishment of the National Health
                            Service (NHS), which  guaranteed a minimum standard of health care
                            for all, free at the point of use. A national system of benefits
                            was also introduced to provide ‘social security’, so that the population
                            would be protected from the ‘cradle to the grave’. The government took
                            into public ownership (nationalised) the railways, coal mines and gas,
                            water and electricity supplies.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another aspect of change was self-government for former colonies.
                            In 1947, independence was granted to nine countries, including India,
                            Pakistan and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Other colonies in Africa,
                            the Caribbean and the Pacific achieved independence over the next 20 years.

                        <p>
                            The UK developed its own atomic bomb and joined the new North Atlantic
                            Treaty Organization (NATO), an alliance of nations set up to resist the
                            perceived threat of invasion by the Soviet Union and it allies.

                            Britain had a Conservative government from 1951 to 1964. The 1950s were a
                            period of economic recovery after the war and increasing prosperity for
                            working people. The Prime Minister of the day, Harold Macmillan, was
                            famous for his ‘wind of change’ speech about decolonisation and independence
                            for the countries of the Empire.

                        <h3>Clement Attlee (1883-1967)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Clement Attlee was born in London in 1883. His father was a solicitor and,
                            after studying at Oxford University, Attlee became a barrister. He gave this up
                             to do social work in East London and eventually became a Labour MP. He was
                            Winston Churchill’s Deputy Prime Minister in the wartime coalition government
                            and became Prime Minister after the Labour Party won the 1945 election. He was
                            Prime Minister from 1945 to 1951 and led the Labour Party for 20 years. Attlee’s
                            government undertook the nationalisation of major industries (like coal and steel),
                            created the National Health Service and implemented many of Beveridge’s plans for a
                            stronger welfare state. Attlee also introduced measures to improve the conditions of workers.

                        <h3>William Beveridge (1879-1963)</h3>

                        <p>
                            William Beveridge (later Lord Beveridge) was a British economist and reformer.
                            He served briefly as a Liberal MP and was subsequently the leader of the Liberals
                            in the House of Lords but is best known for the 1942 report Social Insurance and Allied Services
                            (known as the Beveridge Report). The report was commissioned by the wartime government in 1941.
                            It recommended that the government should find ways of fighting the five ‘Giant Evils’ of Want,
                            Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness and provided the basis of the modern welfare state.

                        <h3>R A Butler (1902-82)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Richard Austen Butler (later Lord Butler) was born in 1902.
                            He became a Conservative MP in 1923 and held several positions before becoming
                            responsible for education in 1941. In this role, he oversaw the introduction of the Education
                            Act 1944 (often called ‘The Butler Act’), which introduced free secondary education in
                            England and Wales. The education system has changed significantly since the Act was introduced,
                            but the division between primary and secondary schools that it enforced still remains in most areas of Britain.

                        <h3>Dylan Thomas (1914-53)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Dylan Thomas was a Welsh poet and writer. He often read and performed his work in public,
                            including for the BBC. His most well-known works include the radio play Under Milk Wood,
                            first performed after his death in 1954, and the poem Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night,
                            which he wrote for his dying father in 1952. He died at the age of 39 in New York. There are
                            several memorials to him in his birthplace, Swansea, including a statue and the Dylan Thomas Centre.

                        <h3>Migration in Post-war Britain</h3>

                        <p>
                            Rebuilding Britain after the Second World War was a huge task. There were labour shortages
                            and the British government encouraged workers from Ireland and other parts of Europe to
                            come to the UK and help with the reconstruction. In 1948, people from the West Indies were
                            also invited to come and work.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During the 1950s, there was still a shortage of labour in the UK. Further immigration was
                            therefore encouraged for economic reasons, and many industries advertised for workers from overseas.
                            For example, centres were set up in the West Indies to recruit people to drive buses. Textile and
                            engineering firms from the north of England and the Midlands sent agents to India and Pakistan to
                            find workers. For about 25 years, people from the West Indies, India, Pakistan and (later)
                            Bangladesh travelled to work and settle in Britain.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Social change in the 1960s</h3>

                        <p>
                            The decade of the 1960s was a period of significant social change. It was known as the
                            ‘swinging sixties’. There was growth in British fashion, cinema and popular music.
                            Two well-known pop music groups at the time were The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.
                            People started to become better off and many bought cars and other consumer goods.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It was also a time when social laws were liberalised, for example in relation to divorce
                            and to abortion in England, Wales and Scotland. The position of women in the workplace
                            also improved. It was quite common at the time for employers to ask women to leave their
                            jobs when they got married, but Parliament passed new laws giving women the right to
                            equal pay and made it illegal for employers to discriminate against women because of their gender.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The 1960s was also a time of technological progress. Britain and France developed the
                            world’s only supersonic commercial airliner, Concorde. New styles of architecture,
                            including high-rise buildings and the use of concrete and steel, became common.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The number of people migrating from the West Indies, India, Pakistan and what is now
                            Bangladesh fell in the late 1960s because the government passed new laws to restrict
                            immigration to Britain. Immigrants were required to have a strong connection to
                            Britain through birth or ancestry. Even so, during the early 1970s, Britain
                            admitted 28,000 people of Indian origin who had been forced to leave Uganda.

                        <div class="informative">
                            <h3>Britain has given the world some wonderful inventions. Examples from the 20th century include:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The television was developed by Scotsman John Logie Baird (1888-1946) in the 1920s. In 1932 he made the first television broadcast between London and Glasgow.</li>
                                <li>Radar was developed by Scotsman Sir Robert Watson-Watt (1892-1973), who proposed that enemy aircraft could be detected by radio waves. The first successful radar test took place in 1935.</li>
                                <li>Working with radar led Sir Bernard Lovell (1913-2012) to make new discoveries in astronomy. The radio telescope he built at Jodrell Bank in Cheshire was for many years the biggest in the world and continues to operate today.</li>
                                <li>A Turing machine is a theoretical mathematical device invented by Alan Turing (1912-54), a British mathematician, in the 1930s. The theory was influential in the development of computer science and the modern-day computer.</li>
                                <li>The Scottish physician and researcher John Macleod (1876-1935) was the co-discoverer of insulin, used to treat diabetes.</li>
                                <li>The structure of the DNA molecule was discovered in 1953 through work at British universities in London and Cambridge. This discovery contributed to many scientific advances, particularly in medicine and fighting crime. Francis Crick (1916-2004), one of those awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery, was British.</li>
                                <li>The jet engine was developed in Britain in the 1930s by Sir Frank Whittle (1907-96), a British Royal Air Force engineer</li>
                                <li>Sir Christopher Cockrell (1910-99), a British inventor, invented the hovercraft in the the 1950s.</li>
                                <li>Britain and France developed Concorde, the world’s only supersonic passenger aircraft. It first flew in 1969 and began carrying passengers in 1976. Concorde was retired from service in 2003.</li>
                                <li>The Harrier jump jet, an aircraft capable of taking off vertically, was also designed and developed in the UK.</li>
                                <li>In the 1960s, James Goodfellow (1937-) invented the cash-dispensing ATM (automatic teller machine) or ‘cashpoint’. The first of these was put into use by Barclays Bank in Enfield, north London in 1967.</li>
                                <li>IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) therapy for the treatment of infertility was pioneered in Britain by physiologist Sir Robert Edwards (1925-) and gynaecologist Patrick Steptoe (1913-88). The world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ was born in Oldham, Lancashire in 1978.</li>
                                <li>In 1996, two British scientists, Sir Ian Wilmot (1944-) and Keith Campbell (1954-2012), led a team which was the first to succeed in cloning a mammal, Dolly the sheep. This has led to further research into the possible use of cloning to preserve endangered species and for medical purposes.</li>
                                <li>Sir Peter Mansfield (1933-), a British scientist, is the co-inventor of the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanner. This enables doctors and researchers to obtain exact and non-invasive images of human internal organs and has revolutionised diagnostic medicine.</li>
                                <li>The inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee (1955-), is British. Information was successfully transferred via the web for the first time on 25 December 1990.</li>

                        <h3>Problem in the economy in the 1970s</h3>

                        <p>
                            In the late 1970s, the post-war economic boom came to an end. Prices of goods and raw materials began to
                            rise sharply and the exchange rate between the pound and other currencies was unstable. This caused
                            problems with the ‘balance of payments’: imports of goods were valued at more than the price paid for exports.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Many industries and services were affected by strikes and this caused problems between the trade
                            unions and the government. People began to argue that the unions were too powerful and that their
                            activities were harming the UK.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The 1970s were also a time of serious unrest in Northern Ireland. In 1972, the Northern Ireland
                            Parliament was suspended and Northern Ireland was directly ruled by the UK government.
                            Some 3,000 people lost their lives in the decades after 1969 in the violence of Northern Ireland.

                        <h3>Mary Peters (1939-)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Born in Manchester, Mary Peters moved to Northern Ireland as a child. She was a talented
                            athlete who won an Olympic gold medal in the pentathlon in 1972. After this, she raised
                            money for local athletics and became the team manager for the women’s British Olympic team.
                            She continues to promote sport and tourism in Northern Ireland and was made a Dame of the
                            British Empire in 2000 in recognition of her work.

                        <p>
                            West Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands formed the European
                            Economic Community (EEC) in 1957. At first the UK did not wish to join the EEC but it
                            eventually did so in 1973. The UK is a full member of the European Union but does not
                            use the Euro currency.

                        <h3>Conservative government from 1979 to 1997</h3>

                        <p>
                            Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s first woman Prime Minister, led the Conservative government
                            from 1979 to 1990. The government made structural changes to the economy through the
                            privatisation of nationalised industries and imposed legal controls on trade union powers.
                            Deregulation saw a great increase in the role of the City of London as an international
                            centre for investments, insurance and other financial services. Traditional industries,
                            such as shipbuilding and coal mining, declined. In 1982, Argentina invaded the Falkland
                            Islands, a British overseas territory in the South Atlantic. A naval task force was
                            sent from the UK and military action led to the recovery of the islands.

                        <p>
                            John Major was Prime Minister after Mrs Thatcher, and helped establish the Northern Ireland peace process.

                        <h3>Margaret Thatcher (1925- 2013)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Margaret Thatcher was the daughter of a grocer from Grantham in Lincolnshire.
                            She trained as a chemist and lawyer. She was elected as a Conservative MP in
                            1959 and became a cabinet minister in 1970 as the Secretary of State for
                            Education and Science. In 1975 she was elected as Leader of the Conservative
                            Party and so became Leader of the Opposition. Margaret Thatcher was the first
                            female Prime Minister of the UK.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Following the Conservative victory in the General Election in 1979, Margaret
                            Thatcher became the first woman Prime Minister of the UK. She was the
                            longest-serving Prime Minister of the 20th century, remaining in office until 1990.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During her premiership, there were a number of important economic reforms
                            within the UK. She worked closely with the United States President,
                            Ronald Reagan, and was one of the first Western leaders to recognise
                            and welcome the changes in the leadership of the Soviet Union which
                            eventually led to the end of the Cold War.

                        <h3>Roald Dahl (1916-1990)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Roald Dahl was born in Wales to Norwegian parents. He served in the Royal Air
                            Force during the Second World War. It was during the 1940s that he began to
                            publish books and short stories. He is most well known for his children’s
                            books, although he also wrote for adults. His best-known works include
                            Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and George’s Marvellous Medicine.
                            Several of his books have been made into films.

                            In 1997 the Labour Party led by Tony Blair was elected.
                            The Blair government introduced a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Assembly (see page 129).
                            The Scottish Parliament has substantial powers to legislate. The Welsh Assembly was given
                            fewer legislative powers but considerable control over public services. In Northern Ireland,
                            the Blair government was able to build on the Peace process, resulting in the Good Friday
                            Agreement signed in 1998. The Northern Ireland Assembly was elected in 1999 but suspended
                            in 2002. It was not reinstated until 2007. Most paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland have
                            decommissioned their arms and are inactive. Gordon Brown took over as Prime Minister in 2007.

                        <h3>Conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq</h3>

                        <p>
                            Throughout the 1990s, Britain played a leading role in coalition forces involved in the liberation
                            of Kuwait, following the Iraqi invasion in 1990, and the conflict in the former Republic of Yugoslavia.
                            Since 2000, British armed forces have been engaged in the global fight against international terrorism
                            and against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including operations in Afghanistan and
                            Iraq. British combat troops left Iraq in 2009. The UK now operates in Afghanistan as part of the
                            United Nations (UN) mandated 50-nation International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) coalition
                            and at the invitation of the Afghan government. ISAF is working to ensure that Afghan territory
                            can never again be used as a safe haven for international terrorism, where groups such as
                            Al Qa’ida could plan attacks on the international community. As part of this, ISAF is
                            building up the Afghan of this, ISAF is building up the Afghan National Security Forces
                            and is helping to create a secure environment in which governance and development can be
                            extended. International forces are gradually handing over responsibility for security to
                            the Afghans, who will have full security responsibility in all provinces by the end of 2014.

                        <h3>Coalition government 2010 onwards</h3>

                        <p>
                            In May 2010, and for the first time in the UK since February 1974, no political party won an overall
                            majority in the General Election. The Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties formed a coalition
                            and the leader of the Conservative Party, David Cameron, became Prime Minister.

                        <p>
                            The UK today is a more diverse society than it was 100 years ago, in both
                            ethnic and religious terms. Post-war immigration means that nearly 10% of
                            the population has a parent or grandparent born outside the UK. The UK continues
                            to be a multinational and multiracial society with a rich and varied culture.
                            This section will tell you about the different parts of the UK and some of the
                            important places. It will also explain some of the UK’s traditions and customs
                            and some of the popular activities that take place.

                        <h3>The nations of the UK</h3>

                        <p>
                            The UK is located in the north west of Europe. The longest distance on
                            the mainland is from John O’Groats on the north coast of Scotland to Land’s
                            End in the south-west corner of England. It is about 870 miles (approximately 1,400 kilometres).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Most people live in towns and cities but much of Britain is still countryside.
                            Many people continue to visit the countryside for holidays and for leisure
                            activities such as walking, camping and fishing.
                        </p>

                            The currency in the UK is the pound sterling (symbol £). There are 100 pence in a pound.
                            The denominations (values) of currency are:

                        <p>
                            Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own banknotes,
                            which are valid everywhere in the UK. However, shops and businesses do not have to accept them.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Languages and dialects</h3>

                        <p>
                            There are many variations in language in the different parts of the UK. The English
                            language has many accents and dialects. In Wales, many people speak Welsh – a completely
                            different language from English – and it is taught in schools and universities.
                            In Scotland, Gaelic (again, a different language) is spoken in some parts of the
                            Highlands and Islands, and in Northern Ireland some people speak Irish Gaelic.

                            Population growth has been faster in more recent years. Migration into the UK and longer
                            life expectancy have played a part in population growth.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The population is very unequally distributed over the four parts of the UK. England more
                            or less consistently makes up 84% of the total population, Wales around 5%, Scotland just
                            over 8%, and Northern Ireland less than 3%.

                        <h3>An ageing population</h3>

                        <p>
                            People in the UK are living longer than ever before. This is due to improved
                            living standards and better health care. There are now a record number of
                            people aged 85 and over. This has an impact on the cost of pensions and health care.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Ethnic diversity</h3>

                        <p>
                            The UK population is ethnically diverse and changing rapidly, especially in large cities
                            such as London. It is not always easy to get an exact picture of
                            the ethnic origin of all the population.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are people in the UK with ethnic origins from all over the world. In surveys,
                            the most common ethnic description chosen is white, which includes people of European,
                            Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and American descent. Other significant groups are
                            those of Asian, black and mixed descent.
                        </p>

                        <h3>An equal society</h3>

                        <p>
                            Within the UK, it is a legal requirement that men and women should not be discriminated
                            against because of their gender or because the are, or are not, married. They have equal
                            rights to work, own property, marry and divorce. If they are married, both parents
                            are equally responsible for their children.

                            Women in Britain today make up about half of the workforce. On average, girls leave
                            school with better qualifications than boys. More women than men study at university.

                        <p>
                            Employment opportunities for women are much greater than they were in the past.
                            Women work in all sectors of the economy, and there are now more women in high-level
                            positions than ever before, including senior mangers in traditionally male-dominated
                            occupations. Alongside this, men now work in more varied jobs than they did in the past.

                        <p>
                            It is now longer expected that women should stay at home and not work. Women often
                            continue to work after having children. Women often continue to work after having
                            children. In many families today, both partners work and both share responsibility
                            for childcare and household chores
                        </p>

                        <h3>Religion</h3>

                        <p>
                            The UK is historically a Christian country. In the 2011 Census, 59% of people
                            identified themselves as Christian. Much smaller proportions identified themselves
                            as Muslim (4.8%), Hindu (1.5%), Sikh (0.8%), Jewish or Buddhist (both less than 0.5%).
                            There are religious buildings for other religions all over the UK. This includes Islamic mosques,
                            Hindu temples, Jewish synagogues, Sikh gurdwaras and Buddhist temples.
                            However, everyone has the legal right to choose their religion, or to choose
                            not to practise a religion. In the 2011 census, 25% of people said that they had no religion.

                        <h3>Christian churches</h3>

                        <p>
                            In England, there is a constitutional link between Church and state.
                            The official Church of the state is the Church of England (called the
                            Anglican Church in other countries and the Episcopal Church in Scotland
                            and the United States). It is a Protestant Church and has existed since
                            the Reformation in the 1530s.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The monarch is the head of the Church of England. The spiritual leader of the
                            Church of England is the Archbishop of Canterbury. The monarch has the right to
                            select the Archbishop and other senior church officials, but usually the choice
                            is made by the Prime Minister and a committee appointed by the Church. Several
                            Church of England bishops sit in the House of Lords.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Scotland, the national Church is the Church of Scotland, which is a Presbyterian
                            Church. It is governed by ministers and elders. The chairperson of the General
                            Assembly of the Church of Scotland is the  Moderator, who is appointed for one
                            year only and often speaks on behalf of that Church.

                        <p>
                            There is no established Church in Wales or Northern Ireland.

                        <p>
                            Other Protestant Christian groups in the UK are Baptists, Methodists,
                            Presbyterians and Quakers. There are also other denominations of
                            Christianity, the biggest of which is Roman Catholic.

                            <span class="bold">Christmas Day</span>
                            , 25 December, celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ.
                            It is a public holiday. Many Christians go to church on
                            Christmas Eve (24 December) or on Christmas Day itself.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Christmas is celebrated in a traditional way. People usually spend the day at home
                            and eat a special meal, which often includes roast turkey, Christmas
                            pudding and mince pies. They give gifts, send cards and decorate their houses.
                            Christmas is a special time for children. Very young children believe that
                            Father Christmas (also known as Santa Claus) brings them presents during the
                            night before Christmas Day. Many people decorate a tree in their home.

                            is the day after Christmas Day and is a public holiday.
                        </p>

                            <span class="bold">Easter </span>
                            takes place in March or April. It marks the death of Jesus Christ on Good Friday and
                            his rising from the dead on Easter Sunday. Both Good Friday and the
                            following Monday, called Easter Monday, are public holidays.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The 40 days before Easter are known as Lent. It is a time when Christians take
                            time to reflect and  prepare for Easter. Traditionally, people would fast during
                            this period and today many people will give something up, like a favourite food.
                            The day before Lent starts is called Shrove Tuesday, or Pancake Day. People eat
                            pancakes, which were traditionally made to use up foods such as eggs, fat and
                            milk before fasting. Lent begins on Ash Wednesday. There are church services
                            where Christians are marked with an ash cross on their forehead as a symbol
                            of death and sorrow for sin. Easter is also celebrated by people who are not
                            religious. ‘Easter eggs’ are chocolate eggs given as presents as a symbol of new life.

                            normally falls in October or November and lasts for five days. It is often
                            called the Festival of Lights. It is celebrated by Hindus and Sikhs.
                            It celebrates the victory of good over evil and the gaining of knowledge.
                            There are different stories about how the festival came about. There is a
                            famous celebration of Diwali in Leicester. Diwali is popularly known as the Festival of Lights.

                            <span class="bold">Hannukah </span>
                            is in November or December and is celebrated for eight days. It is to remember
                            the Jews’ struggle for religious freedom. On each day of the festival a candle
                            is lit on a stand of eight candles (called a menorah) to remember the story of
                            the festival, where oil that should have lasted only a day did so for eight.

                            celebrates the end of Ramadan, when Muslims have fasted for a month. They thank
                            Allah for giving them the strength to complete the fast. The date when it
                            takes place changes every year. Muslims attend special services and meals.

                            remembers that the prophet Ibrahim was willing to sacrifice his son when
                            God ordered him to. It reminds Muslims of their own commitment to God.
                            Many Muslims sacrifice an animal to eat during this festival. In Britain
                            this has to be done in a slaughterhouse.

                            Originally it commemorated the dead of the First World War, which ended on 11
                            November 1918. People wear poppies (the red flower found on the battlefields
                            of the First World War). At 11.00 am there is a two-minute silence and wreaths

                            As well as those mentioned previously, there are other public holidays each year called
                            bank holidays, when banks and many other businesses are closed for the day.
                            These are of no religious significance. They are at the beginning of May in
                            late May or early June, and in August. In Northern Ireland, the anniversary of
                            the Battle of the Boyne in July is also a public holiday.

                            several sports that are particularly popular in the UK. Many sporting events

                            Local governments and private companies provide sports facilities such as swimming pools,
                            tennis courts, football pitches, dry ski slopes and gymnasiums. Many famous sports,

                            origin in the work of Dr Sir Ludwig Guttman, a German refugee, at the Stoke
                            Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire. Dr Guttman developed new methods of
                            treatment for people with spinal injuries and encouraged patients to take part in exercise and sport.

                        <p>
                            Cricket originated in England and is now played in many countries. Games can last up to five
                            days but still result in a draw! The idiosyncratic nature of the game and its complex laws are
                            said to reflect the best of the British character and sense of fair play. You may come across
                            expressions such as ‘rain stopped play’, ‘batting on a sticky wicket’, ‘playing a straight bat’,
                            ‘bowled a googly’ or ‘it’s just not cricket’, which have passed into everyday usage. The most
                            famous competition is the Ashes, which is a series of Test matches played between England and Australia.

                            home team. There can be great rivalry between different football clubs and among fans.

                            event is held in the UK each year and a number of British Grand Prix drivers have won
                            the Formula 1 World Championship. Recent British winners include Damon Hill,
                            Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button.

                        <p>
                            Skiing is increasingly popular in the UK. Many people go abroad to ski and there
                            are also dry slopes throughout the UK. Skiing on snow may also be possible during
                            the winter. There are five ski centres in Scotland, as well as Europe’s longest dry
                            ski slope near Edinburgh.

                        <p>
                            Music is an important part of British culture, with a rich and varied heritage.
                            It ranges from classical music to modern pop. There are many different venues
                            and musical events that take place across the UK.

                            The Proms is an eight-week summer season of orchestral classical music that takes
                            place in various venues, including the Royal Albert Hall in London. It has been in
                            various venues, including the Royal Albert Hall in London. It has been organised by
                            the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) since 1927.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Last Night of the Proms is the most well-known concert and (along with others in the series)
                            is broadcast on television.

                        <p>
                            Classical music has been popular in the UK for centuries. <span class="bold">Henry Purcell (1659-95)</span> was
                            the organist at Westminster Abbey. He wrote church music, operas and other pieces, and
                            developed a British style distinct from that elsewhere in Europe.
                            He continues to be influential on British composers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The German-born composer <span class="bold">George Frederick Handel (1695-1759)</span> spent many years in the UK and became a British citizen in 1727.
                            He wrote the Water Music for King George I and Music for the Royal Fireworks for his son, George II.
                            Both these pieces continue to be very popular. Handel also wrote an oratorio, Messiah, which is
                            sung regularly by choirs, often at Easter time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            More recently, important composers include <span class="bold">Gustav Holst (1874-1934)</span>, whose work includes The Planets,
                            a suite of pieces themed around the planets and the solar system. He adapted Jupiter, part of the Planets
                            suite, as the tune for I owe to thee my country, a popular hymn in British churches.

                        <p>
                            <span class="bold">Sir Edward Elgar (1857-1934)</span>
                            was born in Worcester, England. His best known work is probably the Pomp and Circumstance Marches.
                            March No1 (Land of Hope and Glory) is usually played at the Last Night of the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall.

                        <p>
                            <span class="bold">Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958)</span>
                            wrote music for orchestras and choirs. He was strongly influenced by traditional English folk music.

                        <p>
                            <span class="bold">Sir William Walton (1902-83)</span>
                            wrote a wide range of music, from film scores to opera. He wrote marches for the coronations of
                            King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II but his best-known works are probably Façade, which became
                            a ballet, and Balthazar’s Feast, which is intended to be sung by a large choir.

                            <span class="bold">Benjamin Britten (1913-76)</span>
                            is best known for his operas, which include Peter Grimes and Billy Budd.
                            He also wrote A Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra, which is based on a
                            piece of music by Purcell and introduces the listener to the various different
                            sections of an orchestra. He founded the Aldeburgh festival in Suffolk, which
                            continues to be a popular music event of international importance.

                            Other types of popular music, including folk music, jazz, pop and rock music,
                            have flourished in Britain since the 20th century. Britain has had an impact on
                            popular music around the world, due to the wide use of the English language,
                            the UK’s cultural links with many countries, and British capacity for invention and innovation.

                            Since the 1960s, British pop music has made one of the most important
                            cultural contributions to life in the UK. Bands including The Beatles and
                            The Rolling Stones continue to have an influence on music both here and abroad.
                            British pop music has continued to innovate – for example, the Punk movement of the
                            late 1970s, and the trend towards boy and girl bands in the 1990s.

                        <p>
                            There are many large venues that host music events throughout the year, such as:
                            Wembley Stadium; The O2 in Greenwich, south-east London; and the Scottish
                            Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) in Glasgow.

                            Festival season takes place across the UK every summer, with major events in various locations.
                            Famous festivals include Glastonbury, the Isle of Wight Festival and the V Festival. Many bands
                            and solo artists, both well-known and up-and-coming, perform at these events.

                        <h3>Theatre</h3>

                        <p>
                            There are theatres in most towns and cities throughout the UK, ranging from the large to the small.
                            They are an important part of local communities and often show both professional and amateur productions.
                            London’s west end, also known as ‘Theatreland’, is particularly well known. The Mousetrap, a murder-mystery
                            play by Dame Agatha Christie, has been running in the west end since 1952 and has had the longest initial
                            run of any show in history.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There is also a strong tradition of musical theatre in the UK. In the 19th century, Gilbert
                            and Sullivan wrote comic operas, often making fun of popular culture and politics. These operas
                            include HMS Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado. Gilbert and Sullivan’s work is still
                            often staged by professional and amateur groups. More recently, Andrew Lloyd Webber has written the
                            music for shows which have been popular throughout the world, including, in collaboration with Tim Rice,
                            Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita, and also Cats and The Phantom of the Opera.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One British tradition is the pantomime. Many theatres produce a pantomime at Christmas time.
                            They are based on fairy stories and are light-hearted plays with music and comedy, enjoyed by
                            family audiences. One of the traditional characters is the Dame, a woman played by a man. There
                            is often also a pantomime horse or cow played by two actors in the same costume.

                            The Edinburgh Festival takes place in Edinburgh, Scotland, every summer.
                            It is a series of different arts and cultural festivals, with the biggest and most
                            well-known being the Edinburgh Festival Fringe (‘the Fringe’). The Fringe is a showcase
                            of mainly theatre and comedy performances. It often shows experimental work.

                            The Laurence Olivier Awards take place annually at different venues in London. There are a variety
                            of categories, including best director, best actor and best actress. The awards are named after the
                            British actor Sir Laurence Olivier, late Lord Olivier, who was best known for his
                            roles in various Shakespeare plays.

                        <h3>Art</h3>

                        <p>
                            During the Middle Ages, most art had a religious theme, particularly wall paintings in churches and
                            illustrations in religious books. Much of this was lost after the Protestant Reformation but wealthy
                            families began to collect other paintings and sculptures. Many of the painters working in Britain
                            in the 16th and 17th centuries were from abroad-for example, Hans Holbein and Sir Anthony Van Dyck.
                            British artists, particularly those painting portraits and landscapes, became well
                            known from the 18th century onwards.

                            Works by British and international artists are displayed in Galleries across the UK.
                            Some of the most well-known galleries are The National Gallery, Tate Britain and Tate Modern in London,
                            the National Museum in Cardiff, and the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh.

                        <h3>Architecture</h3>

                        <p>
                            The architectural heritage of the UK is rich and varied. In the Middle Ages, great cathedrals and churches
                            were built, many of which still stand today. Examples are the cathedrals in Durham, Lincoln, Canterbury
                            and Salisbury. The White Tower in the Tower of London is an example of a Norman castle keep, built on
                            the orders of William the Conqueror.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Gradually, as the countryside became more peaceful and landowners became richer,
                            the houses of the wealthy became more elaborate and great country houses such as Hardwick Hall in
                            Derbyshire were built. British styles of architecture began to evolve.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the 17th century, Inigo Jones took inspiration from classical architecture to design the
                            Queen’s House at Greenwich and the Banqueting House in Whitehall in London. Later in the century,
                            Sir Christopher Wren helped develop a British version of the ornate styles popular in Europe in
                            buildings such as the new St Paul’s Cathedral.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the 18th century, simpler designs became popular. The Scottish architect Robert Adam influenced the
                            development of architecture in the UK, Europe and America. He designed the inside decoration as well as
                            the building itself in great houses such as Dumfries House in Scotland. His ideas influenced architects in
                            cities such as Bath, where the Royal Crescent was built.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the 19th century, the medieval ’gothic’ style became popular again. As cities expanded,
                            many great public buildings were built in this style. The Houses of Parliament and St Pancras Station
                            were built at this time, as were the town halls in cities such as Manchester and Sheffield.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the 20th century, Sir Edwin Lutyens had an influence throughout the British Empire.
                            He designed New Delhi to be the seat of government in India. After the First World War,
                            he was responsible for many war memorials throughout the world, including the Cenotaph in Whitehall.
                            The Cenotaph is the site of the annual Remembrance Day service attended by the Queen,
                            politicians and foreign ambassadors.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Modern British architects including Sir Norman Foster, Lord (Richard) Rogers and Dame Zaha Hadid
                            continue to work on major projects throughout the world as well as within the UK.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Alongside the development of architecture, garden design and landscaping have played an important
                            role in the UK. In the 18th century, Lancelot ‘Capability’ Brown designed the grounds around country
                            houses so that the landscape appeared to be natural, with grass, trees and lakes. He often worked with
                            Edwin Lutyens to design colourful gardens around the houses he designed. Gardens continue to be an
                            important part of homes in the UK. The annual Chelsea Flower Show showcases garden design from Britain and around the world.

                        <h3>Fashion and design</h3>

                        <p>
                            Britain has produced many great designers, from Thomas Chippendale (who designed furniture in the 18th century)
                            to Clarice Cliff (who designed Art Deco ceramics) to Sir Terence Conran (a 20th-century interior designer).
                            Leading fashion designers of recent years include Mary Quant, Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Literature</h3>

                        <p>
                            The UK has a prestigious literary history and tradition. Several British writers,
                            including the novelist Sir William Golding, the poet Seamus Heaney, and the playwright
                            Harold Pinter, have won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Other authors have become well
                            known in popular fiction. Agatha Christie’s detective stories are read all over the
                            world and Ian Fleming’s books introduced James Bond. In 2003, The Lord of the Rings
                            by JRR Tolkien was voted the country’s best-loved novel.

                        <p>
                            The Man Booker Prize for Fiction is awarded annually for the best fiction novel
                            written by an author from the Commonwealth, Ireland or Zimbabwe. It has been
                            awarded since 1968. Past winners include Ian McEwan, Hilary Mantel and Julian Barnes.

                        <h3>British poets</h3>

                        <p>
                            British poetry is among the richest in the world. The Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf tells of its hero’s
                            battles against monsters and is still translated into modern English.
                            Poems which survive from the Middle Ages include Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales
                            and a poem called Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, about one of the knights at the court of King Arthur.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As well as plays, Shakespeare wrote many sonnets (poems which must be 14 lines long) and some longer poems.
                            As Protestant ideas spread, a number of poets wrote poems inspired by their religious views.
                            One of these was John Milton, who wrote Paradise Lost.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Other poets, including William Wordsworth, were inspired by nature. Sir Walter Scott wrote poems
                            inspired by Scotland and the traditional stories and songs from the area on the borders of Scotland and England.
                            He also wrote novels, many of which were set in Scotland.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Poetry was very popular in the 19th century, with poets such as William Blake, John Keats,
                            Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, Alfred Lord Tennyson, and Robert and Elizabeth Browning. Later,
                            many poets-for example, Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon – were inspired to write about
                            their experiences in the First World War. More recently, popular poets have included Sir Walter de la Mare,
                            John Masefield, Sir John Betjeman and Ted Hughes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some of the best-known poets are buried or commemorated in Poet’s Corner in Westminster Abbey.

                        <p>
                            A lot of people have gardens at home and will spend their free time
                            looking after them. Some people rent additional land called ‘an allotment’,
                            where they grow fruit and vegetables. Gardening and flower shows range from
                            major national exhibitions to small local events. Many towns have garden centres
                            selling plants and gardening equipment. There are famous gardens to visit throughout
                            the UK, including Kew Gardens, Sissinghurst and Hidcote in England, Crathes Castle and
                            Inveraray Castle in Scotland, Bodnant Garden in Wales, and Mount Stewart in Northern Ireland.

                        <p>
                            The countries that make up the UK all have flowers which are particularly
                            associated with them and which are sometimes worn on national saints’ days:

                        <h3>Shopping</h3>

                        <p>
                            There are many different places to go shopping in the UK. Most towns and cities have a
                            central shopping area, which is called the town centre. Undercover shopping centres
                            are also common – these might be in town centres or on the outskirts of a town or
                            city. Most shops in the UK are open seven days a week, although trading hours on
                            Sundays and public holidays are generally reduced. Many towns also have markets
                            on one or more days a week, where stallholders sell a variety of goods.

                        <h3>Cooking and food</h3>

                        <p>
                            Many people in the UK enjoy cooking. They often invite each other to
                            their homes for dinner. A wide variety of food is eaten in the UK because
                            of the country’s rich cultural heritage and diverse population.

                        <h3>British film industry</h3>

                        <p>
                            The UK has had a major influence on modern cinema.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Films were first shown publicly in the UK in 1896 and film screenings very
                            quickly became popular. From the beginning, British film makers became famous
                            for clever special effects and this continues to be an area of British expertise.
                            From the early days of the cinema, British actors have worked in both UK and USA.
                            Sir Charles (Charlie) Chaplin became famous in silent movies for his tramp character
                            and was one of many British actors to make a career in Hollywood.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            British studios flourished in the 1930s. Eminent directors included Sir Alexander Korda
                            and Sir Alfred Hitchcock, who later left for Hollywood and remained an important
                            film director until his death in 1980. During the Second World War, British movies
                            (for example, In Which We Serve) played an important part in boosting morale. Later,
                            British directors including Sir David Lean and Ridley Scott found great
                            success both in the UK and internationally.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The 1950s and 1960s were a high point for British comedies, including
                            Passport to Pimlico, The Ladykilllers and, later, the Carry On Films.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Many of the films now produced in the UK are made by foreign companies,
                            using British expertise. Some of the most commercially successful films of
                            all time, including the two highest-grossing film franchises (Harry Potter and James Bond),
                            have been produced in the UK. Ealing Studios has a claim to being the oldest continuously
                            working film studio facility in the world. Britain continues to be particularly strong in
                            special effects and animation. One example is the work of Nick Park, who has won four
                            Oscars for his animated films, including three for films featuring Wallace and Gromit.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Actors such as Sir Lawrence Olivier, David Niven, Sir Rex Harrison and Richard Burton
                            starred in a wide variety of popular films. British actors continue to be popular and
                            continue to win awards throughout the world. Recent British actors to have won Oscars
                            include Colin Firth, Sir Antony Hopkins, Dame Judi Dench, Kate Winslet and Tilda Swinton.

                            The annual British Academy Film Awards, hosted by the British Academy of Film and
                            Television Arts (BAFTA), are the British equivalent of the Oscars.

                        <h3>British comedy</h3>

                        <p>
                            The traditions of comedy and satire, and the ability to laugh at ourselves,
                            are an important part of the UK character.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Medieval kings and rich nobles had jesters who told jokes and made fun of
                            people in the Court. Later, Shakespeare included comic characters in his plays.
                            In the 18th century, political cartoons attacking prominent politicians – and,
                            sometimes, the monarch or other members of the Royal Family – became increasingly
                            popular. In the 19th century, satirical magazines began to be published.
                            The most famous was Punch, which was published for the first time in the 1840s.
                            Today, political cartoons continue to be published in newspapers, and magazines
                            such as Private Eye continue the tradition of satire.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Comedians were a popular feature of British music hall, a form of variety
                            theatre which was very common until television became the leading form of
                            entertainment in the UK. Some of the people who had performed in the music halls
                            in the 1940s and 1950s, such as Morecambe and Wise, became stars of television.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Television comedy developed its own style. Situation comedies, or sitcoms,
                            which often look at family life and relationships in the workplace, remain popular.
                            Satire has also continued to be important, with shows like That Was The Week That Was
                            in the 1960s and Spitting Image in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1969, Monty Python’s Flying Circus
                            introduced a new type of progressive comedy. Stand-up comedy, where a solo comedian talks
                            to a live audience, has become popular again in recent years.

                        <h3>Television and radio</h3>

                        <p>
                            Many different television (TV) channels are available in the UK. Some are free to watch a
                            wide variety of programmes. Popular programmes include regular soap operas such as
                            Coronation Street and EastEnders. In Scotland, some Scotland-specific programmes
                            are shown and there is also a channel with programmes in the Gaelic language.
                            There is a Welsh-language channel in Wales. There are also programmes specific
                            to Northern Ireland and some programmes broadcast in Irish Gaelic.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Everyone in the UK with a TV, computer or other medium which can be used for watching TV must
                            have a television licence. One licence covers all of the equipment in one home, except
                            when people rent different rooms in a shared house and each has a separate tenancy
                            agreement – those people must each buy a separate licence. People over 75 can apply
                            for a free TV licence and blind people can get a 50% discount. You will receive a
                            fine up to £1,000 if you watch TV but do not have a TV licence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The money from TV licences is used to pay for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
                            This is a public service broadcaster providing television and radio programmes.
                            The BBC is the largest broadcaster in the world. It is the only wholly state-funded
                            media organisation that is independent of government. Other UK channels are primarily
                            funded through advertisements and subscriptions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are also many different radio stations in the UK. Some broadcast nationally
                            and others in certain cities or regions. There are radio stations that play certain
                            types of music and some broadcast in regional languages such as Welsh or Gaelic.
                            Like television, BBC radio stations are funded by TV licences and other radio
                            stations are funded through advertisements.

                        <h3>Social networking</h3>

                        <p>
                            Social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter are a popular way for people
                            to stay in touch with friends, organise social events, and share photos, videos and opinions.
                            Many people use social networking on their mobile phones when out and about.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Pubs and night clubs</h3>

                        <p>
                            Public houses (pubs) are an important part of the UK social culture.
                            Many people enjoy meeting friends in the pub. Most communities will have a ‘local’ pub
                            that is a natural focal point for social activities. Pub quizzes are popular.
                            Pool and darts are traditional pub games. To buy alcohol in a pub or night club you
                            must be 18 or over, but people under that age may be allowed in some pubs with an adult.
                            When they are 16, people can drink wine or beer with a meal in a hotel or restaurant
                            (including eating areas in pubs) as long as they are with someone over 18.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Pubs are usually open during the day from 11.00 am (12 noon on Sundays).
                            Night clubs with dancing and music usually open and close later than pubs.

                        <h3>Betting and gambling</h3>

                        <p>
                            In the UK, people often enjoy a gamble on sports or other events.
                            There are also casinos in many places. You have to be 18 to go into
                            betting shops or gambling clubs. There is a National Lottery for which
                            draws are made every week. You can enter by buying a ticket or a scratch card.
                            People under 16 are not allowed to participate in the National Lottery.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Pets</h3>

                        <p>
                            A lot of people in the UK have pets such as cats or dogs.
                            They might have them for company or because they enjoy looking after them.
                            It is against the law to treat a pet cruelly or to neglect it.
                            All dogs in public places must wear a collar showing the name and address of the owner.
                            The owner is responsible for keeping the dog under control and for cleaning
                            up after the animal in a public place.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Vaccinations and medical treatment for animals are available from veterinary surgeons (vets).
                            There are charities which may help people who cannot afford to pay a vet.

                        <h3>Places of interest</h3>

                        <p>
                            The UK has a large network of public footpaths in the countryside.
                            There are also many opportunities for mountain biking, mountaineering and hill walking.
                            There are 15 national parks in England, Wales and Scotland. They are areas of protected
                            countryside that everyone can visit, and where people live, work and look after the landscape.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are many museums in the UK, which range from small community museums to
                            large national and civic collections. Famous landmarks exist in towns, cities
                            and the countryside throughout the UK. Most of them are open to the public to view (generally for a charge).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Many parts of the countryside and places of interest are kept open by the National Trust in England,
                            Wales and Northern Ireland and the National Trust for Scotland. Both are charities that work to preserve
                            important buildings, coastline and countryside in the UK. The National Trust was founded in 1895 by three volunteers.
                            There are now more than 61,000 volunteers helping to keep the organisation running.

                        <h3>The development of British democracy</h3>

                        <p>
                            The UK is a parliamentary democracy with the monarch as head of state. T
                            his section will tell you about the different institutions which make up this
                            democratic system and explain how you can play a part in the democratic process.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Democracy is a system of government where the whole adult population gets a say.
                            This might be by direct voting or by choosing representatives to make decisions on their behalf.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the turn of the 19th century, Britain was not a democracy as we know it today.
                            Although there were elections to select members of Parliament (MPs), only a small
                            group of people could vote. They were men who were over 21 years of age and who
                            owned a certain amount of property.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The franchise (that is the number of people who had the right to vote)
                            grew over the course of the 19th century and political parties
                            began to involve ordinary men and women as members.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the 1830s and 1840s, a group called the Chartists campaigned
                            for reform. They wanted six changes:
                        </p>

                        <div class="informative">

                            <ul>
                                <li>for every man to have the vote</li>
                                <li>elections every year</li>
                                <li>for all regions to be equal in the electoral system</li>

                                <li>for any man to be able to stand as an MP</li>
                                <li>for MPs to be paid</li>
                            </ul>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            At the time, the campaign was generally seen as failure. However, by 1918 most
                            of these reforms had been adopted. The voting franchise was also extended to women
                            over 30, and then in 1928 to men and women over 21. In 1969, the voting age was
                            reduced to 18 for men and women.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The British constitution</h3>

                        <p>
                            A constitution is a set of principles by which a country is governed.
                            It includes all of the institutions that are responsible for running the country
                            and how their power is kept in check. The constitution also includes laws and conventions.
                            The British constitution is not written down in any single document, and therefore it is
                            described as ‘unwritten’. This is mainly because the UK, unlike America or France,
                            has never had a revolution which led permanently to a totally new system of government.
                            Our most important institutions have developed over hundreds of years. Some people
                            believe that there should be a single document, but others believe an unwritten
                            constitution allows for more flexibility and better government.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The monarchy</h3>

                        <p>
                            Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state of the UK. She is also the monarch or head of
                            state for many countries in the Commonwealth. The UK has a constitutional monarchy.
                            This means that the king or queen does not rule the country but appoints the government,

                            of the party with the largest number of MPs or the leader of a coalition between more
                            than one party, to become the Prime Minister. The monarch has regular meetings with
                            the Prime Minister and can advise, warn and encourage, but the decisions on government
                            policies are made by the Prime Minister and cabinet.

                            The Queen has reigned since her father’s death in 1952, and in 2012 she celebrated her
                            Diamond Jubilee (60 years as queen). She is married to Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.
                            Her eldest son, Prince Charles (the Prince of Wales), is the heir to the throne.

                        <p>
                            The Queen has important ceremonial roles, such as the opening of the new parliamentary
                            session each year. On this occasion the Queen makes a speech which summarises the
                            government’s policies for the year ahead. All Acts of Parliament are made in her name.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Queen represents the UK to the rest of the world. She receives foreign
                            ambassadors and high commissioners, entertains visiting heads of state, and
                            makes state visits overseas in support of diplomatic and economic relationships with other counties.

                        <p>
                            The Queen has an important role in providing stability and continuity.
                            While governments and Prime Ministers change regularly, the Queen continues as head of state.
                            She provides a focus for national identity and pride, which was demonstrated through the celebrations of her Jubilee.

                            It is played at important national occasions and at events attended by the Queen or the Royal Family.
                            The first verse is:

                        <h3>System of government</h3>

                        <p>
                            The system of government in the UK is a parliamentary democracy.
                            The UK is divided into parliamentary constituencies. Voters in each constituency
                            elect their Member of Parliament (MP) in a General Election. All of the elected
                            MPs form the House of Commons. Most MPs belong to a political party, and the party
                            with the majority of MPs forms the government. If one party does not get a majority,
                            two parties can join together to form a coalition.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The House of Commons</h3>

                        <p>
                            The House of Commons is regarded as the more important of the two chambers in
                            Parliament because its members are democratically elected. The Prime Minister and
                            almost all the members of the cabinet are members of the House of Commons (MPs).
                            Each MP represents a parliamentary constituency, which is a small area of the country.
                            MPs have a number of different responsibilities. They:

                        <p>
                            Members of the House of Lords, known as peers, are not elected by the people
                            and do not represent a constituency. The role and membership of the House of
                            Lords has changed over the last 50 years.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Since 1958, the Prime Minister has had the power to nominate peers just for their own lifetime.
                            These are called life peers. They have usually had an important career in politics,
                            business, law or another profession. Life peers are appointed by the monarch on
                            the advice of the Prime Minister. They also include people nominated by the
                            leaders of the other main political parties or by an independent
                            Appointments Commission for non-party peers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Since 1999, hereditary peers have lost the automatic right to attend the
                            House of Lords. They now elect a few of their number to represent them in the House of Lords.

                        <p>
                            The House of Lords is normally more independent of the government
                            than the House of Commons. It can suggest amendments or propose new
                            laws, which are then discussed by MPs. The House of Lords checks laws
                            that have been passed by the House of Commons to ensure they are fit
                            for purpose. It also holds the government to account to make sure that
                            it is working in the best interests of the people. There are peers who
                            are specialists in particular areas, and their knowledge is useful in
                            making and checking laws. The House of Commons has powers to overrule the
                            House of Lords, but these are not used often.

                        <p>
                            Debates in the House of Commons are chaired by the Speaker. This person is
                            the chief officer of the House of Commons. The Speaker is neutral and does
                            not represent a political party, even though he or she is an MP, represents
                            a constituency and deals with the constituents’ problems like any other MP.
                            The Speaker is chosen by other MPs in a secret ballot.

                        <p>
                            The Speaker keeps order during political debates to make sure the rules are
                            followed. This includes making sure the opposition (see the section on ‘The government’)
                            has a guaranteed amount of time to debate issues which it chooses. The Speaker
                            also represents Parliament on ceremonial occasions.

                        <p>
                            MPs are elected at a General Election, which is held at least every five years.

                        <p>
                            If an MP dies or resigns, there will be a fresh election, called a by-election,
                            in his or her constituency.

                        <p>
                            MPs are elected through a system called ‘first past the post’. In each constituency,
                            the candidate who gets the most votes is elected. The government is usually formed by
                            the party that wins the majority of constituencies. If no party wins a majority,
                            two parties may join together to form a coalition.

                            Elected members are called members of the European Parliament (MEPs).
                            Elections to the European Parliament use a system of proportional representation,
                            where seats are allocated to each party in proportion to the total number
                            of votes it has won.

                            You can get contact details for all your representatives and their parties
                            from your local library and from www.parliament.uk. MPs, Assembly members,
                            members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and MEPs are also listed in
                            The Phone Book, published by BT, and in Yellow Pages.

                            MSPs and MEPs hold regular local ‘surgeries’, where constituents can go in person
                            to talk about issues that are of concern to them. These surgeries are often

                        <p>
                            The Prime Minister (PM) is the leader of the political party in power.
                            He or she appoints the members of the cabinet (see below) and has control
                            over many important public appointments. The official home of the
                            Prime Minister is 10 Downing Street, in central London, near the Houses of Parliament.
                            He or she also has a country house outside London called Chequers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Prime Minister can be changed if the MPs in the governing party decide to do so,
                            or if he or she wishes to resign. The Prime Minister usually resigns if his or
                            her party loses a General Election.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Prime Minister appoints about 20 senior MPs to become ministers in charge of departments. These include:

                                <li>Home Secretary – responsible for crime, policing and immigration</li>
                                <li>Foreign Secretary – responsible for managing relationships with foreign countries</li>

                        <p>
                            These ministers form the cabinet, a committee which usually meets weekly and makes
                            important decisions about government policy. Many of the decisions have to be debated or approved by Parliament.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Each department also has a number of other ministers, called Ministers of State and Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State,
                            who take charge of particular areas of the department’s work.

                            The second-largest party in the House of Commons is called the opposition.
                            The leader of the opposition usually becomes Prime Minister if his of her party wins the next General Election.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The leader of the opposition leads his or her party in pointing out what they see as the government’s
                            failures and weaknesses. One important opportunity to do this is at Prime Minister’s Questions,
                            which takes place every week while Parliament is sitting. The leader of the opposition also
                            appoints senior opposition MPs to be ‘shadow ministers’. They form the shadow cabinet and
                            their role is to challenge the government and put forward alternative policies.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The party system</h3>

                        <p>
                            Anyone aged 18 or over can stand for election as an MP but they are unlikely to win
                            unless they have been nominated to represent one of the major political parties.
                            These are the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, or one of
                            the parties representing Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish interests.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are a few MPs who do not represent any of the main political parties.
                            They are called ‘independents’ and usually represent an issue important to their constituency.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The main political parties actively look for members of the public to join their
                            debates, contribute to their costs, and help at elections for Parliament or for
                            local government. They have branches in most constituencies and hold policy-making
                            conferences every year.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Pressure and lobby groups are organisations which try to influence government policy.
                            They play an important role in politics. Some are representative organisations such
                            as the CBI (Confederation of British Industry), which represents the views of British business.
                            Others campaign on particular topics, such as the environment (for example, Greenpeace)
                            or human rights (for example, Liberty).
                        </p>

                        <h3>The civil service</h3>

                        <p>
                            Civil servants support the government in developing and implementing its policies.
                            They also deliver public services. Civil servants are accountable to ministers.
                            They are chosen on merit and are politically neutral – they are not political appointees.
                            People can apply to join the civil service through an application process, like other
                            jobs in the UK. Civil servants are expected to carry out their role with dedication
                            and a commitment to the civil service and its core values. These are: integrity,
                            honesty, objectivity and impartiality (including being politically neutral).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Local government</h3>

                        <p>
                            Towns, cities and rural areas in the UK are governed by democratically elected councils,
                            often called ‘local authorities’. Some areas have both district and county councils,
                            which have different functions. Most large towns and cities have a single local authority.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Local authorities provide a range of services in their areas.
                            They are funded by money from central government and by local taxes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Many local authorities appoint a mayor, who is the ceremonial leader of the council.
                            In some towns, a mayor is elected to be the effective leader of the administration.
                            London has 33 local authorities, with the Greater London Authority and the Mayor of
                            London coordinating policies across the capital. For most local authorities,
                            local elections for councillors are held in May every year. Many candidates
                            stand for council election as members of a political party.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Devolved administrations</h3>

                        <p>
                            Since 1997, some powers have been devolved from the central government to give people in
                            Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland more control over matters that directly affect them.
                            There has been a Welsh Assembly and a Scottish Parliament since 1999.
                            There is also a Northern Ireland Assembly, although this has been suspended on a few occasions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Policy and laws governing defence, foreign affairs, immigration, taxation and social security
                            all remain under central UK government control. However, many other public services,
                            such as education, are controlled by the devolved administrations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The devolved administrations each have their own civil service.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Welsh government</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Welsh government and National Assembly for Wales are based in Cardiff, the capital city of Wales.
                            The National Assembly has 60 Assembly members (AMs) and elections are held every four years using
                            a form of proportional representation. Members can speak in either Welsh or English, and all of
                            the Assembly’s publications are in both languages.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Assembly has the power to make laws for Wales in 21 areas, including:</p>

                            Since 2011, the National Assembly for Wales has been able to pass laws on
                            these topics without the agreement of the UK Parliament.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Welsh Assembly building opened in March 2006.

                        <h3>The Scottish Parliament</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Scottish Parliament was formed in 1999. It sits in Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are 129 members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), elected by a form of proportional representation.
                            The Scottish Parliament can pass laws for Scotland of all matters which are not specifically
                            reserved to the UK Parliament. The matters on which the Scottish Parliament can legislate include:

                            The Scottish Parliament building opened in October 2004.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Northern Ireland Assembly</h3>

                        <p>
                            A Northern Ireland Parliament was established in 1922, when Ireland was divided,
                            but it was abolished in 1972, shortly after the Troubles broke out in 1969.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Northern Ireland Assembly was established soon after the Belfast Agreement (or Good Friday Agreement)
                            in 1998. There is a power-sharing agreement which distributes ministerial offices amongst the
                            main parties. The Assembly has 108 elected members, known as MLAs (members of the Legislative Assembly).
                            They are elected with a form of proportional representation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Northern Ireland Assembly can make decisions on issues such as:

                        <p>
                            The UK government has the power to suspend all devolved assemblies.
                            It has used this power several times in Northern Ireland when local political
                            leaders found it difficult to work together. However, the Assembly been running
                            successfully since 2007.

                        <h3>The media and government</h3>

                        <p>
                            Proceedings in Parliament are broadcast on television and published in official reports called Hansard.
                            Written reports can be found in large libraries and at www.parliament.uk.
                            Most people get information about political issues and events from newspapers
                            (often called ‘the press’), television, radio and the internet.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The UK has a free press. This means that what is written in newspapers is free from government control.
                            Some newspaper owners and editors hold strong political opinions and run campaigns to try
                            to influence government policy and public opinion.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By law, radio and television coverage of the political parties must be balanced
                            and so equal time has to be given to rival viewpoints.

                        <p>
                            The UK has had a fully democratic voting system since 1928. The present voting age of 18 was set
                            in 1969 and (with a few exceptions) all UK-born and naturalised adult citizens have the right to vote.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Adult citizens of the UK, and citizens of the Commonwealth and the Irish Republic who are resident
                            in the UK, can vote in all public elections. Adult citizens of other EU states who are resident
                            in the UK can vote in all elections except General Elections.
                        </p>

                            To be able to vote in a parliamentary, local or European election,
                            you must have your name on the electoral register.

                        <p>
                            If you are eligible to vote, you can register by contacting your local
                            council electoral registration office. This is usually based at your
                            local council (in Scotland it may be based elsewhere). If you don’t
                            know which local authority you come under, you can find out by
                            visiting <a href="www.aboutmyvote.co.uk">www.aboutmyvote.co.uk</a> and

                            The electoral register is updated every year in September or October.
                            An electoral registration form is sent to every household and this has
                            to be completed and returned with the names of everyone who is resident

                            ‘individual registration’ and all those entitled to vote must
                            complete their own registration form. Once registered, people
                            stay on the register provided their personal details do not change.
                            For more information see the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland
                            website at <a href="www.eoni.org.uk">www.eoni.org.uk</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By law, each local authority has to make its electoral register available
                            for anyone to look at, although this has to be supervised. The register
                            is kept at each local electoral registration office (or council office in England and Wales).
                            It is also possible to see the register at some public buildings such as libraries.

                        <h3>Where to vote</h3>

                        <p>
                            People vote in elections at places called polling stations, or polling places in Scotland.
                            Before the election you will be sent a poll card. This tells you where your polling station
                            or polling place is and when the election will take place. On election day, the polling
                            station or place will be open from 7.00 am until 10.00 pm.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When you arrive at the polling station, the staff will ask for your name and address.
                            In Northern Ireland you will also have to show photographic identification. You will
                            then get your ballot paper, which you take to a polling booth to fill in privately.
                            You should make up your own mind who to vote for. No one has the right to make you
                            vote for a particular candidate. You should follow the instructions on ballot paper.
                            Once you have completed it, put it in the ballot box.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If it is difficult for you to get to a polling station or polling place, you can register
                            for a postal ballot. Your ballot paper will be sent to your home before the election. You then
                            fill it in and post it back. You can choose to do this when you register to vote.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Commonwealth is an association of countries that support each other
                            and work together towards shared goals in democracy and development.
                            Most member states were once part of the British Empire, although a
                            few countries which were not have also joined.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Queen is the ceremonial head of the Commonwealth, which currently
                            has 52 member states. Membership is voluntary. The Commonwealth has no
                            power over its members, although it can suspend membership.
                            The Commonwealth is based on the core values of democracy, good
                            government and the rule of law.

                            The European Union (EU), originally called the European Economic Community (EEC),
                            was set up by six western European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands)
                            who signed the Treaty of Rome on 25 March 1957. The UK originally decided not to join this group but it became a member in 1973.
                            There are now 28 EU member states. In a referendum held on 23 June 2016 the UK voted to leave the European Union.

                        <p>
                            One of the most important responsibilities of all residents in the UK is to know and obey the law.
                            This section will tell you about the legal system in the UK and some of the laws that may affect you.
                            Britain is proud of being a welcoming country, but all residents, regardless of their background,
                            are expected to comply with the law and to understand that some things which may be allowed in
                            other legal systems are not acceptable in the UK. Those who do not respect the law should not
                            expect to be allowed to become permanent residents of the UK.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The law is relevant to all areas of life in the UK. You should make sure that you are aware of the
                            laws which affect your everyday life, including both your personal and business affairs.

                        <h3>The law in the UK</h3>

                        <p>
                            Every person in the UK receives equal treatment under the law. This means that the law applies in the same
                            way to everyone, no matter who they are or where they are from.
                        </p>

                                <li>Protect life and property</li>
                                <li>Prevent disturbances (also known as keeping the peace)</li>
                                <li>Prevent and detect crime.</li>
                            </ul>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            The police are organised into a number of separate police forces headed by Chief Constables.
                            They are independent of the government.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In November 2012, the public elected Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) in England and Wales.
                            These are directly elected individuals who are responsible for the delivery of an efficient and
                            effective police force that reflects the needs of their local communities. PCCs set local police
                            priorities and the local policing budget. They also appoint the local Chief Constable.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The police force is a public service that helps and protects everyone, no matter what
                            their background or where they live. Police officers must themselves obey the law. They
                            must not misuse their authority, make a false statement, be rude or abusive, or commit racial
                            discrimination. If police officers corrupt or misuse their authority they are severely punished.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Police officers are supported by the police community support officers (PCSOs).
                            PCSOs have different roles according to the area but usually patrol the streets, work with the public,
                            and support police officers at crime scenes and major events.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            All people in the UK are expected to help the police prevent and detect crimes whenever they can.
                            If you are arrested and taken to a police station, a police officer will tell you the reason for
                            your arrest and you will be able to seek legal advice.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If something goes wrong, the police complaints system tries to put it right.
                            Anyone can make a complaint about the police by going to a police station and writing to
                            the Chief Constable of the police force involved. Complaints can also be made to an independent
                            body: the Independent Police Complaints Commission in England and Wales, the
                            Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland or the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Terrorism and extremism</h3>

                        <p>
                            The UK faces a range of terrorist threats. The most serious of these is from Al Qa’ida,
                            its affiliates and like-minded organisations. The UK also faces threats from other kind
                            of terrorism, such as Northern Ireland-related terrorism.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            All terrorist groups try to radicalise and recruit people to their cause. How, where and to what
                            extent they try to do so will vary. Evidence shows that these groups attract very low levels of
                            public support, but people who want to make their home in the UK should be aware of this threat.
                            It is important that all citizens feel safe. This includes feeling safe from all kinds of extremism
                            (vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values), including religious extremism and far-right extremism.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you think someone is trying to persuade you to join an extremist or terrorist cause,
                            you should notify your local police force.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="highlight">The role of the courts</h3>

                        <h3>The judiciary</h3>

                        <p>
                            Judges (who are together called ‘the judiciary’) are responsible for interpreting the law and
                            ensuring that trials are conducted fairly. The government cannot interfere with this.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Sometimes the actions of the government are claimed to be illegal. If the judges agree,
                            then the government must either change its policies or ask Parliament to change the law.
                            If judges find that a public body is not respecting someone’s legal rights, they can
                            order that body to change its practices and/or pay compensation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Judges also make decisions in disputes between members of the public or organisations.
                            These might be about contracts, property or employment rights or after an accident.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Criminal courts</h3>

                        <p>
                            There are some differences between the court systems in
                            England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Magistrates’ and Justice of the Peace Courts</h3>

                        <p>
                            In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, most minor criminal cases are dealt with in a Magistrates’ Court.
                            In Scotland, minor criminal offences go to a Justice of the Peace Court.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Magistrates and Justices of the Peace (JPs) are members of the local community.
                            In England, Wales and Scotland they usually work unpaid and do not need legal qualifications.
                            They receive training to do the job and are supported by a legal adviser.
                            Magistrates decide the verdict in each case that comes before them and,
                            if the person is found guilty, the sentence that they are given.
                            In Northern Ireland, cases are heard by a District Judge or Deputy District Judge, who is legally qualified and paid.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Crown Courts and Sheriff Courts</h3>

                        <p>
                            In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, serious offences are tried in front of a judge and a jury in a Crown Court.
                            In Scotland, serious cases are heard in a Sheriff Court with either a sheriff or a sheriff with a jury.
                            The most serious cases in Scotland, such as murder, are heard at a High Court with a judge and jury.
                            A jury is made up of members of the public chosen at random from the local electoral register.
                            In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a jury has 12 members, and in Scotland a jury has 15 members.
                            Everyone who is summoned to do jury service must do it unless they are not eligible (for example,
                            because they have a criminal conviction) or they provide a good reason to be excused, such as ill health.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The jury has to listen to the evidence presented at the trial and then decide a verdict of ‘guilty’
                            or ‘not guilty’ based of what they have heard. In Scotland, a third verdict of ‘not proven’ is also possible.
                            If the jury finds a defendant guilty, the judge decides the penalty.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Youth Courts</h3>

                        <p>
                            In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, if an accused person is aged 10 to 17, the case is normally heard in
                            a Youth Court in front of up to three specially trained magistrates or a District Judge. The most serious
                            cases will go the Crown Court. The parents or carers of the young person are expected to attend the hearing.
                            Members of the public are not allowed in Youth Courts, and the name or photographs of the accused young person
                            cannot be published in newspapers or used by the media.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Scotland a system called the Children’s Hearings System is used to deal with children and young people who have committed an offence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Northern Ireland has a system of youth conferencing to consider how a child should be dealt with when they have committed an offence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Old Bailey is probably the most famous criminal court in the world
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="highlight">Civil courts</h3>

                        <h3>County Courts</h3>

                        <p>
                            County Courts deal with a wide range of civil disputes. These include people trying to get back money that is owed to them,
                            cases involving personal injury, family matters, breaches of contract, and divorce. In Scotland, most of these matters are
                            dealt with in the Sheriff Court. More serious civil cases – for example, when a large amount of compensation is being
                            claimed – are dealt with in the High Court of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, they are dealt with
                            in the Court of Session in Edinburgh.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The small claims procedure</h3>

                        <p>
                            The small claims procedure is an informal way of helping people to settle minor disputes without spending a lot of time
                            and money using a lawyer. This procedure is used for claims of less than £10,000 in England and Wales and £3,000 in
                            Scotland and Northern Ireland. The hearing is held in front of a judge in an ordinary room, and people from both
                            sides of the dispute sit around a table. Small claims can also be issued online through
                            Money Claims Online (<a href="www.moneyclaim.gov.uk">www.moneyclaim.gov.uk</a>).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Solicitors</h3>

                        <p>
                            Solicitors are trained lawyers who give advice on legal matters, take action for their
                            clients and represent their clients in court.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are solicitors’ offices throughout the UK. It is important to find out which aspects of
                            law a solicitor specialises in and to check that they have the right experience to help you
                            with your case. Many advertise in local newspapers and in Yellow Pages.
                            The Citizens Advice Bureau (<a href="www.citizensadvice.org.uk">www.citizensadvice.org.uk</a>)
                            can give you names of local solicitors
                            and which areas of law they specialise in. You can also get this information from the
                            Law Society (<a href="www.lawsociety.org.uk">www.lawsociety.org.uk</a>) in England and Wales, the Law Society of Scotland
                            (<a href="www.lawscot.org.uk">www.lawscot.org.uk</a>) or the Law Society of
                            Northern Ireland (<a href="www.lawsoc-ni.org">www.lawsoc-ni.org</a>).
                            Solicitors’ charges are usually based on how much time they spend of a case.
                            It is very important to find out at the start how much a case is likely to cost.

                        <p>
                            Britain has a long history of respecting an individual’s rights and ensuring essential freedoms.
                            These rights have their roots in Magna Carta, the Habeas Corpus Act and the Bill of Rights of
                            1689, and they have developed over a period of time. British diplomats and lawyers had an
                            important role in drafting the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
                            The UK was one of the first countries to sign the Convention in 1950.

                            The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporated the European Convention of Human Rights into UK law. The government,
                            public bodies and the courts must follow the principles of the Convention.

                        <p>
                            UK laws ensure that people are not treated unfairly in any area of life or work because of their age,
                            disability, sex, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sexuality or marital status.
                            If you face problems with discrimination, you can get more information from the
                            Citizens Advice Bureau or from one of the following organisations:

                        <p>
                            In the UK, brutality and violence in the home is a serious crime.
                            Anyone who is violent towards their partner – whether they are a man or
                            a woman, married or living together – can be prosecuted. Any man who forces a
                            woman to have sex, including a woman’s husband, can be charged with rape.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is important for anyone facing domestic violence to get help as soon as possible.
                            A solicitor or the Citizens Advice Bureau can explain the available options.
                            In some areas there are safe places to go and stay in, called refuges or shelters.
                            There are emergency telephone numbers in the helpline section at the front of
                            Yellow Pages, including, for women, the number of the nearest women’s centre.
                            You can also phone the 24-hour National Domestic Violence Freephone Helpline
                            on 0808 2000 247 at any time, or the police can help you find a safe place to stay.

                        <h3>Female genital mutilation</h3>

                        <p>
                            Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as cutting or female circumcision, is illegal
                            in the UK. Practicing FGM or taking a girl or woman abroad for FGM is a criminal offence.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Forced marriage</h3>

                        <p>
                            A marriage should be entered into with the full and free consent of both people involved.
                            Arranged marriages, where both parties agree to the marriage, are acceptable in the UK.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Forced marriage is where one or both parties do not or cannot give their consent to enter into the partnership.
                            Forcing another person to marry is a criminal offence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Forced Marriage Protection Orders were introduced in 2008 for England, Wales and Northern Ireland under
                            the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007. Court orders can be obtained to protect a person
                            from being forced into a marriage, or to protect a person in a forced marriage.
                            Similar Protection Orders were introduced in Scotland in November 2011.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A potential victim, or someone acting for them, can apply for an order.
                            Anyone found to have breached an order can be jailed for up to two years for contempt of court.

                        <p>
                            Money raised from income tax pays for government services such as roads, education, police and the armed forces.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For most people, the right amount of income tax is automatically taken from their income from employment
                            by their employer and paid directly to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the government department
                            that collects taxes. This system is called “Pay As You Earn” (PAYE).
                            If you are self-employed, you need to pay your own tax through a system called ‘self-assessment’,
                            which includes completing a tax return. Other people may also need to complete a tax return.
                            If HMRC sends you a tax return, it is important to completed and return the form as soon as
                            you have all the necessary information.

                        <h3>National Insurance</h3>

                        <p>
                            Almost everybody in the UK who is in paid work, including self-employed people,
                            must pay National Insurance Contributions. The money raised from National Insurance Contributions
                            is used to pay for state benefits and services such as the state retirement pension and the National Health Service (NHS).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Employees have their National Insurance Contributions deducted from their pay by their employer.
                            People who are self-employed need to pay National Insurance Contributions themselves.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Anyone who does not pay enough National Insurance Contributions will not be able to receive certain
                            contributory benefits such as Jobseeker’s Allowance or a full state retirement pension. Some workers,
                            such as part-time workers, may not qualify for statutory payments such as maternity pay if they do not earn enough.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Further guidance about National Insurance Contributions is available on HMRC’s website at

                        </p>

                        <h3>Getting a National Insurance number</h3>

                        <p>
                            A National Insurance number is a unique personal account number. It makes sure that the
                            National Insurance Contributions and tax you pay are properly recorded against your name.
                            All young people in the UK are sent a National Insurance number just before their 16th birthday.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A non-UK national living in the UK and looking for work, starting work or setting up as self-employed will
                            need a National Insurance number. However, you can start work without one. If you have permission to work
                            in the UK, you will need to telephone the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to arrange to get a
                            National Insurance number. You may be required to attend an interview. The DWP will advise you of the
                            appropriate application process and tell you which documents you will need to bring to an interview
                            if one is necessary. You will usually need documents that prove your identity and that you have
                            permission to work in the UK. A National Insurance number does not on its own prove to an employer
                            that you have the right to work in the UK.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Driving</h3>

                        <p>
                            In the UK, you must be at least 17 years to drive a car or motor cycle and you must have a driving licence
                            to drive on public roads. To get a UK driving licence you must pass a driving test, which tests both your
                            knowledge and your practical skills. You need to be at least 16 years old to ride a moped, and there are
                            other age requirements and special tests for driving large vehicles.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Drivers can use their driving licence until they are 70 years old. After that, the licence is valid for three years at a time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Northern Ireland, a newly qualified driver must display an ‘R’ plate (for restricted driver) for one year
                            after passing the test.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If your driving licence if from a country in the European Union (EU), Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway, you can
                            drive in the UK for as long as your licence is valid. If you have a licence from any other country, you may use
                            it in the UK for up to 12 months. To continue driving after that, you must get a UK full driving licence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you are resident in the UK, your car or motor cycle must be registered at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).
                            You must pay an annual road tax and display the tax disc, which shows that the tax has been paid, on the windowscreen.
                            You must also have valid motor insurance. It is a serious criminal offence to drive without insurance.
                            If you vehicle is over three years old, you must take it to the Ministry of Transport (MOT) test every year.
                            It is an offense not to have a MOT certificate if your vehicle is more than three years old. You can find
                            out more about vehicle tax and MOT requirements from <a href="www.gov.uk">www.gov.uk</a>

                            Taking on these values and responsibilities will make it easier for you to become a full and active citizen.

                        <h3>Being a good neighbour</h3>

                        <p>
                            When you move into a new house or apartment, introduce yourself to the people who live near you.
                            Getting to know your neighbours can help you to become part of the community and make friends.
                            Your neighbours are also a good source of help – for example, they may be willing to feed your pets
                            if you are away, or offer advice on local shops and services.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can help prevent any problems and conflicts with your neighbours by respecting their privacy
                            and limiting how much noise you make. Also try to keep your garden tidy, and only put your refuse
                            bags and bins on the street or in communal areas if they are due to be collected.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Getting involved in local activities</h3>

                        <p>
                            Volunteering and helping your community are an important part of being a good citizen.
                            They enable you to integrate and get to know other people. It helps to make your community a
                            better place if residents support each other. It also helps you to fulfil your duties as a
                            citizen, such as behaving responsibly and helping others.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How you can support your community</h3>

                        <p>
                            There are a number of positive ways in which you can support your community and be a good citizen.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Jury service</h3>

                        <p>
                            As well as getting the right to vote, people on the electoral register are randomly selected to serve on a jury.
                            Anyone who is on the electoral register and is aged 18 to 70 can be asked to do this.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Helping in schools</h3>

                        <p>
                            If you have children, there are many ways in which you can help at their schools.
                            Parents can often help in classrooms, by supporting activities or listening to children read.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Many schools organise events to raise money for extra equipment or out-of school activities.
                            Activities might include book sales, toy sales or bringing food to sell.
                            You might have good ideas of your own for raising money.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Sometimes events are organised by parent-teacher associations (PTAs). Volunteering to help
                            with their events or joining the association is a way of doing something good for the school
                            and also making new friends in your local community. You can find out about these opportunities
                            from notices in the school or notes your children bring home.
                        </p>

                        <h3>School governors and school boards</h3>

                        <p>
                            School governors, or members of the school board in Scotland, are people from the local community who
                            wish to make a positive contribution to their children’s education. They must be aged 18 or over at
                            the date of their election or appointment. There is no upper age limit.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Governors and school boards have an important part to play in raising school standards. They have three key roles:
                        </p>

                        <div class="informative">

                            <ul>
                                <li>Setting the strategic direction of the school</li>
                                <li>Ensuring accountability</li>
                                <li>Monitoring and evaluating school performance.</li>
                            </ul>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            You can contact your local school to ask if they need a new governor or school board member.
                            In England, you can also apply online at the School Governors’ One-Stop Shop at <a href="www.sgoss.org.uk">www.sgoss.org.uk</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In England, parents and other community groups can apply to open a free school in their local area.
                            More information about this can be found on the Department for Education website at <a href="www.dfe.gov.uk">www.dfe.gov.uk</a>

                        <h3>Supporting political parties</h3>

                        <p>
                            Political parties welcome new members. Joining one is a way to demonstrate your support for
                            certain views and to get involved in the democratic process.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Political parties are particularly busy at election times. Members work hard to persuade people to vote
                            for their candidates – for instance, by handing out leaflets in the street or by knocking on people’s
                            doors and asking for their support. This is called ‘canvassing’. You don’t have to tell a canvasser
                            how you intend to vote if you don’t want to.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            British citizens can stand for office as a local councillor, a member of Parliament (or the devolved equivalents)
                            or a member of the European Parliament. This is an opportunity to become even more involved in the political
                            life of the UK. You may also be able to stand for office if you are an Irish citizen, an eligible Commonwealth
                            citizen or (except for standing to be an MP) a citizen of another EU country.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Helping with local services</h3>

                        <p>
                            There are opportunities to volunteer with a wide range of local service providers,
                            including local hospitals and youth projects. Services often want to involve local
                            people in decisions about the way in which they work. Universities, housing associations,
                            museums and arts councils may advertise for people to serve as volunteers in their governing bodies.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can volunteer with the police, and become a special constable or a lay (non-police) representative.
                            You can also apply to become a magistrate. You will often find advertisements for vacancies in your local
                            newspaper or on local radio. You can also find out more about these sorts of roles at <a href="www.gov.uk">www.gov.uk</a>

                        <h3>Blood and organ donation</h3>

                        <p>
                            Donated blood is used by hospitals to help people with a wide range of injuries and illnesses.
                            Giving blood only takes about an hour to do. You can register to give blood at:

                            Many people in the UK are waiting for organ transplants. If you register to be an organ donor,
                            it can make it easier for your family to decide whether to donate your organs when you die.
                            You can register to be an organ donor at <a href="www.organdonation.nhs.uk">www.organdonation.nhs.uk</a>.
                            Living people can also donate a kidney.

                        <p>
                            Volunteering is working for good causes without payment. There are many benefits to volunteering,
                            such as meeting new people and helping make your community a better place. Some volunteer
                            activities will give you a chance to practise your English or develop work skills that
                            will help you find or improve your curriculum vitae (CV). Many people volunteer simply
                            because they want to help other people.

                            There are thousands of active charities and voluntary organizations in the UK.
                            They work to improve the lives of people, animals and the environment in many different ways.
                            They range from the British Red Cross, to small local charities working in particular areas.
                            They include charities working with older people (such as Age UK), with children (for example,
                            the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC)), and with the homeless
                            (for example, Crisis and Shelter). There are also medical research charities (for example, Cancer Research UK),
                            environmental charities (including the National Trust and Friends of the Earth) and charities working
                            with animals (such as the People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA)).

                            Volunteers are needed to help with their activities and to raise money. The charities often advertise in
                            local newspapers, and most have websites that include information about their opportunities.

                            help them to develop their skills. These include the National Citizen Service programme, which gives
                            16- and 17-year-olds the opportunity to enjoy outdoor activities, develop their skills and take part
                            in a community project. You can find out more about these opportunities as follows:

                        <p>
                            It is important to recycle as much of your waste as you can. Using recycled materials to make
                            new products uses less energy and means that we do not need to extract more raw materials from
                            the earth. It also means that less rubbish is created, so the amount being put into landfill is reduced.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can learn more about recycling and it benefits at <a href="www.recyclenow.com">www.recyclenow.com</a>. At this website you can also
                            find out what you can recycle at home and in the local area you live in England. This information
                            is available for Wales at <a href="www.wasteawarenesswales.org.uk">www.wasteawarenesswales.org.uk</a>, for

                        <p>
                            A good way to support your local community is to shop for products locally where you can.
                            This will help businesses and farmers in your area in Britain. It will also reduce your carbon footprint,
                            because the products you buy will not have had to travel as far.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Walking and using public transport to get around when you can is also a good way to protect the environment.
                            It means that you create less pollution that when you use a car.
