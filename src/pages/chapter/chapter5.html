                        <p>
                            The UK is a parliamentary democracy with the monarch as head of state. T
                            his section will tell you about the different institutions which make up this
                            democratic system and explain how you can play a part in the democratic process.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Democracy is a system of government where the whole adult population gets a say.
                            This might be by direct voting or by choosing representatives to make decisions on their behalf.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the turn of the 19th century, Britain was not a democracy as we know it today.
                            Although there were elections to select members of Parliament (MPs), only a small
                            group of people could vote. They were men who were over 21 years of age and who
                            owned a certain amount of property.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The franchise (that is the number of people who had the right to vote)
                            grew over the course of the 19th century and political parties
                            began to involve ordinary men and women as members.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the 1830s and 1840s, a group called the Chartists campaigned
                            for reform. They wanted six changes:

                            At the time, the campaign was generally seen as failure. However, by 1918 most
                            of these reforms had been adopted. The voting franchise was also extended to women
                            over 30, and then in 1928 to men and women over 21. In 1969, the voting age was
                            reduced to 18 for men and women.

                        <h3 class="target5" id="t-5-2">The British constitution</h3>

                        <p>
                            A constitution is a set of principles by which a country is governed.
                            It includes all of the institutions that are responsible for running the country
                            and how their power is kept in check. The constitution also includes laws and conventions.
                            The British constitution is not written down in any single document, and therefore it is
                            described as ‘unwritten’. This is mainly because the UK, unlike America or France,
                            has never had a revolution which led permanently to a totally new system of government.
                            Our most important institutions have developed over hundreds of years. Some people
                            believe that there should be a single document, but others believe an unwritten
                            constitution allows for more flexibility and better government.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In addition, there are devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
                            that have the power to legislate on certain issues.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The monarchy</h3>

                        <p>
                            Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state of the UK. She is also the monarch or head of
                            state for many countries in the Commonwealth. The UK has a constitutional monarchy.
                            This means that the king or queen does not rule the country but appoints the government,
                            which the people have chosen in a democratic election. The monarch invites the leader
                            of the party with the largest number of MPs or the leader of a coalition between more
                            than one party, to become the Prime Minister. The monarch has regular meetings with
                            the Prime Minister and can advise, warn and encourage, but the decisions on government
                            policies are made by the Prime Minister and cabinet.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Queen has reigned since her father’s death in 1952, and in 2012 she celebrated her
                            Diamond Jubilee (60 years as queen). She is married to Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.
                            Her eldest son, Prince Charles (the Prince of Wales), is the heir to the throne.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Queen has important ceremonial roles, such as the opening of the new parliamentary
                            session each year. On this occasion the Queen makes a speech which summarises the
                            government’s policies for the year ahead. All Acts of Parliament are made in her name.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Queen represents the UK to the rest of the world. She receives foreign
                            ambassadors and high commissioners, entertains visiting heads of state, and
                            makes state visits overseas in support of diplomatic and economic relationships with other counties.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Queen has an important role in providing stability and continuity.
                            While governments and Prime Ministers change regularly, the Queen continues as head of state.
                            She provides a focus for national identity and pride, which was demonstrated through the celebrations of her Jubilee.
                        </p>

                        <h4>The National Anthem</h4>

                        <p>
                            The National Anthem of the UK is ‘God Save the Queen’.
                            It is played at important national occasions and at events attended by the Queen or the Royal Family.
                            The first verse is:

                        <h3>System of government</h3>

                        <p>
                            The system of government in the UK is a parliamentary democracy.
                            The UK is divided into parliamentary constituencies. Voters in each constituency
                            elect their Member of Parliament (MP) in a General Election. All of the elected
                            MPs form the House of Commons. Most MPs belong to a political party, and the party
                            with the majority of MPs forms the government. If one party does not get a majority,
                            two parties can join together to form a coalition.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The House of Commons</h3>

                        <p>
                            The House of Commons is regarded as the more important of the two chambers in
                            Parliament because its members are democratically elected. The Prime Minister and
                            almost all the members of the cabinet are members of the House of Commons (MPs).
                            Each MP represents a parliamentary constituency, which is a small area of the country.
                            MPs have a number of different responsibilities. They:

                        <p>
                            Members of the House of Lords, known as peers, are not elected by the people
                            and do not represent a constituency. The role and membership of the House of
                            Lords has changed over the last 50 years.

                        <p>
                            Since 1958, the Prime Minister has had the power to nominate peers just for their own lifetime.
                            These are called life peers. They have usually had an important career in politics,
                            business, law or another profession. Life peers are appointed by the monarch on
                            the advice of the Prime Minister. They also include people nominated by the
                            leaders of the other main political parties or by an independent
                            Appointments Commission for non-party peers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Since 1999, hereditary peers have lost the automatic right to attend the
                            House of Lords. They now elect a few of their number to represent them in the House of Lords.

                        <p>
                            The House of Lords is normally more independent of the government
                            than the House of Commons. It can suggest amendments or propose new
                            laws, which are then discussed by MPs. The House of Lords checks laws
                            that have been passed by the House of Commons to ensure they are fit
                            for purpose. It also holds the government to account to make sure that
                            it is working in the best interests of the people. There are peers who
                            are specialists in particular areas, and their knowledge is useful in
                            making and checking laws. The House of Commons has powers to overrule the
                            House of Lords, but these are not used often.

                            Debates in the House of Commons are chaired by the Speaker. This person is
                            the chief officer of the House of Commons. The Speaker is neutral and does
                            not represent a political party, even though he or she is an MP, represents
                            a constituency and deals with the constituents’ problems like any other MP.
                            The Speaker is chosen by other MPs in a secret ballot.

                        <p>
                            The Speaker keeps order during political debates to make sure the rules are
                            followed. This includes making sure the opposition (see the section on ‘The government’)
                            has a guaranteed amount of time to debate issues which it chooses. The Speaker
                            also represents Parliament on ceremonial occasions.

                        <p>
                            MPs are elected at a General Election, which is held at least every five years.

                        <p>
                            If an MP dies or resigns, there will be a fresh election, called a by-election,
                            in his or her constituency.

                        <p>
                            MPs are elected through a system called ‘first past the post’. In each constituency,
                            the candidate who gets the most votes is elected. The government is usually formed by
                            the party that wins the majority of constituencies. If no party wins a majority,
                            two parties may join together to form a coalition.

                            Elections to the European Parliament use a system of proportional representation,
                            where seats are allocated to each party in proportion to the total number
                            of votes it has won.

                            MSPs and MEPs hold regular local ‘surgeries’, where constituents can go in person
                            to talk about issues that are of concern to them. These surgeries are often

                        <h3>The Prime Minister</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Prime Minister (PM) is the leader of the political party in power.
                            He or she appoints the members of the cabinet (see below) and has control
                            over many important public appointments. The official home of the
                            Prime Minister is 10 Downing Street, in central London, near the Houses of Parliament.
                            He or she also has a country house outside London called Chequers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Prime Minister can be changed if the MPs in the governing party decide to do so,
                            or if he or she wishes to resign. The Prime Minister usually resigns if his or
                            her party loses a General Election.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The cabinet</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Prime Minister appoints about 20 senior MPs to become ministers in charge of departments. These include:
                        </p>

                        <div class="informative">

                            <ul>
                                <li>Chancellor of the Exchequer – responsible for the economy</li>
                                <li>Home Secretary – responsible for crime, policing and immigration</li>
                                <li>Foreign Secretary – responsible for managing relationships with foreign countries</li>
                                <li>Other ministers (called ‘Secretaries of State’) responsible for subjects such as education, health and defence.</li>
                            </ul>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            These ministers form the cabinet, a committee which usually meets weekly and makes
                            important decisions about government policy. Many of the decisions have to be debated or approved by Parliament.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Each department also has a number of other ministers, called Ministers of State and Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State,
                            who take charge of particular areas of the department’s work.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The opposition</h3>

                        <p>
                            The second-largest party in the House of Commons is called the opposition.
                            The leader of the opposition usually becomes Prime Minister if his of her party wins the next General Election.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The leader of the opposition leads his or her party in pointing out what they see as the government’s
                            failures and weaknesses. One important opportunity to do this is at Prime Minister’s Questions,
                            which takes place every week while Parliament is sitting. The leader of the opposition also
                            appoints senior opposition MPs to be ‘shadow ministers’. They form the shadow cabinet and
                            their role is to challenge the government and put forward alternative policies.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The party system</h3>

                        <p>
                            Anyone aged 18 or over can stand for election as an MP but they are unlikely to win
                            unless they have been nominated to represent one of the major political parties.
                            These are the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, or one of
                            the parties representing Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish interests.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are a few MPs who do not represent any of the main political parties.
                            They are called ‘independents’ and usually represent an issue important to their constituency.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The main political parties actively look for members of the public to join their
                            debates, contribute to their costs, and help at elections for Parliament or for
                            local government. They have branches in most constituencies and hold policy-making
                            conferences every year.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Pressure and lobby groups are organisations which try to influence government policy.
                            They play an important role in politics. Some are representative organisations such
                            as the CBI (Confederation of British Industry), which represents the views of British business.
                            Others campaign on particular topics, such as the environment (for example, Greenpeace)
                            or human rights (for example, Liberty).
                        </p>

                        <h3>The civil service</h3>

                        <p>
                            Civil servants support the government in developing and implementing its policies.
                            They also deliver public services. Civil servants are accountable to ministers.
                            They are chosen on merit and are politically neutral – they are not political appointees.
                            People can apply to join the civil service through an application process, like other
                            jobs in the UK. Civil servants are expected to carry out their role with dedication
                            and a commitment to the civil service and its core values. These are: integrity,
                            honesty, objectivity and impartiality (including being politically neutral).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Local government</h3>

                        <p>
                            Towns, cities and rural areas in the UK are governed by democratically elected councils,
                            often called ‘local authorities’. Some areas have both district and county councils,
                            which have different functions. Most large towns and cities have a single local authority.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Local authorities provide a range of services in their areas.
                            They are funded by money from central government and by local taxes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Many local authorities appoint a mayor, who is the ceremonial leader of the council.
                            In some towns, a mayor is elected to be the effective leader of the administration.
                            London has 33 local authorities, with the Greater London Authority and the Mayor of
                            London coordinating policies across the capital. For most local authorities,
                            local elections for councillors are held in May every year. Many candidates
                            stand for council election as members of a political party.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Devolved administrations</h3>

                        <p>
                            Since 1997, some powers have been devolved from the central government to give people in
                            Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland more control over matters that directly affect them.
                            There has been a Welsh Assembly and a Scottish Parliament since 1999.
                            There is also a Northern Ireland Assembly, although this has been suspended on a few occasions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Policy and laws governing defence, foreign affairs, immigration, taxation and social security
                            all remain under central UK government control. However, many other public services,
                            such as education, are controlled by the devolved administrations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The devolved administrations each have their own civil service.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Welsh government</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Welsh government and National Assembly for Wales are based in Cardiff, the capital city of Wales.
                            The National Assembly has 60 Assembly members (AMs) and elections are held every four years using
                            a form of proportional representation. Members can speak in either Welsh or English, and all of
                            the Assembly’s publications are in both languages.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Assembly has the power to make laws for Wales in 21 areas, including:</p>

                        <p>
                            Since 2011, the National Assembly for Wales has been able to pass laws on
                            these topics without the agreement of the UK Parliament.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Welsh Assembly building opened in March 2006.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Scottish Parliament</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Scottish Parliament was formed in 1999. It sits in Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are 129 members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), elected by a form of proportional representation.
                            The Scottish Parliament can pass laws for Scotland of all matters which are not specifically
                            reserved to the UK Parliament. The matters on which the Scottish Parliament can legislate include:

                            The Scottish Parliament building opened in October 2004.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Northern Ireland Assembly</h3>

                        <p>
                            A Northern Ireland Parliament was established in 1922, when Ireland was divided,
                            but it was abolished in 1972, shortly after the Troubles broke out in 1969.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Northern Ireland Assembly was established soon after the Belfast Agreement (or Good Friday Agreement)
                            in 1998. There is a power-sharing agreement which distributes ministerial offices amongst the
                            main parties. The Assembly has 108 elected members, known as MLAs (members of the Legislative Assembly).
                            They are elected with a form of proportional representation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Northern Ireland Assembly can make decisions on issues such as:

                        <p>
                            The UK government has the power to suspend all devolved assemblies.
                            It has used this power several times in Northern Ireland when local political
                            leaders found it difficult to work together. However, the Assembly been running
                            successfully since 2007.

                        <h3>The media and government</h3>

                        <p>
                            Proceedings in Parliament are broadcast on television and published in official reports called Hansard.
                            Written reports can be found in large libraries and at www.parliament.uk.
                            Most people get information about political issues and events from newspapers
                            (often called ‘the press’), television, radio and the internet.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The UK has a free press. This means that what is written in newspapers is free from government control.
                            Some newspaper owners and editors hold strong political opinions and run campaigns to try
                            to influence government policy and public opinion.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By law, radio and television coverage of the political parties must be balanced
                            and so equal time has to be given to rival viewpoints.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Who can vote?</h3>

                        <p>
                            The UK has had a fully democratic voting system since 1928. The present voting age of 18 was set
                            in 1969 and (with a few exceptions) all UK-born and naturalised adult citizens have the right to vote.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Adult citizens of the UK, and citizens of the Commonwealth and the Irish Republic who are resident
                            in the UK, can vote in all public elections. Adult citizens of other EU states who are resident
                            in the UK can vote in all elections except General Elections.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The electoral register</h3>

                        <p>
                            To be able to vote in a parliamentary, local or European election,
                            you must have your name on the electoral register.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you are eligible to vote, you can register by contacting your local
                            council electoral registration office. This is usually based at your
                            local council (in Scotland it may be based elsewhere). If you don’t
                            know which local authority you come under, you can find out by
                            visiting <a href="www.aboutmyvote.co.uk">www.aboutmyvote.co.uk</a> and
                            entering you postcode. You can also download voter registration
                            forms in English, Welsh and some other languages.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The electoral register is updated every year in September or October.
                            An electoral registration form is sent to every household and this has
                            to be completed and returned with the names of everyone who is resident
                            in the household and eligible to vote.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Northern Ireland a different system operates. This is called
                            ‘individual registration’ and all those entitled to vote must
                            complete their own registration form. Once registered, people
                            stay on the register provided their personal details do not change.
                            For more information see the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland
                            website at <a href="www.eoni.org.uk">www.eoni.org.uk</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By law, each local authority has to make its electoral register available
                            for anyone to look at, although this has to be supervised. The register
                            is kept at each local electoral registration office (or council office in England and Wales).
                            It is also possible to see the register at some public buildings such as libraries.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Where to vote</h3>

                        <p>
                            People vote in elections at places called polling stations, or polling places in Scotland.
                            Before the election you will be sent a poll card. This tells you where your polling station
                            or polling place is and when the election will take place. On election day, the polling
                            station or place will be open from 7.00 am until 10.00 pm.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When you arrive at the polling station, the staff will ask for your name and address.
                            In Northern Ireland you will also have to show photographic identification. You will
                            then get your ballot paper, which you take to a polling booth to fill in privately.
                            You should make up your own mind who to vote for. No one has the right to make you
                            vote for a particular candidate. You should follow the instructions on ballot paper.
                            Once you have completed it, put it in the ballot box.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If it is difficult for you to get to a polling station or polling place, you can register
                            for a postal ballot. Your ballot paper will be sent to your home before the election. You then
                            fill it in and post it back. You can choose to do this when you register to vote.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Commonwealth is an association of countries that support each other
                            and work together towards shared goals in democracy and development.
                            Most member states were once part of the British Empire, although a
                            few countries which were not have also joined.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Queen is the ceremonial head of the Commonwealth, which currently
                            has 52 member states. Membership is voluntary. The Commonwealth has no
                            power over its members, although it can suspend membership.
                            The Commonwealth is based on the core values of democracy, good
                            government and the rule of law.

                            The European Union (EU), originally called the European Economic Community (EEC),
                            was set up by six western European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands)
                            who signed the Treaty of Rome on 25 March 1957. The UK originally decided not to join this group but it became a member in 1973.
                            There are now 28 EU member states. In a referendum held on 23 June 2016 the UK voted to leave the European Union.

                            It has no power to make laws but draws up conventions and charters, the most well-known
                            of which is the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, usually

                        <p>
                            One of the most important responsibilities of all residents in the UK is to know and obey the law.
                            This section will tell you about the legal system in the UK and some of the laws that may affect you.
                            Britain is proud of being a welcoming country, but all residents, regardless of their background,
                            are expected to comply with the law and to understand that some things which may be allowed in
                            other legal systems are not acceptable in the UK. Those who do not respect the law should not
                            expect to be allowed to become permanent residents of the UK.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The law is relevant to all areas of life in the UK. You should make sure that you are aware of the
                            laws which affect your everyday life, including both your personal and business affairs.

                        <p>
                            Every person in the UK receives equal treatment under the law. This means that the law applies in the same
                            way to everyone, no matter who they are or where they are from.
                        </p>

                                    The police can also confiscate alcohol or move young people on from public places.
                                    You can be fined or arrested.

                            <h3>The job of the police in the UK is to:</h3>

                                <li>Protect life and property</li>

                            </ul>

                        <p>
                            The police are organised into a number of separate police forces headed by Chief Constables.
                            They are independent of the government.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In November 2012, the public elected Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) in England and Wales.
                            These are directly elected individuals who are responsible for the delivery of an efficient and
                            effective police force that reflects the needs of their local communities. PCCs set local police
                            priorities and the local policing budget. They also appoint the local Chief Constable.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The police force is a public service that helps and protects everyone, no matter what
                            their background or where they live. Police officers must themselves obey the law. They
                            must not misuse their authority, make a false statement, be rude or abusive, or commit racial
                            discrimination. If police officers corrupt or misuse their authority they are severely punished.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Police officers are supported by the police community support officers (PCSOs).
                            PCSOs have different roles according to the area but usually patrol the streets, work with the public,
                            and support police officers at crime scenes and major events.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            All people in the UK are expected to help the police prevent and detect crimes whenever they can.
                            If you are arrested and taken to a police station, a police officer will tell you the reason for
                            your arrest and you will be able to seek legal advice.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If something goes wrong, the police complaints system tries to put it right.
                            Anyone can make a complaint about the police by going to a police station and writing to
                            the Chief Constable of the police force involved. Complaints can also be made to an independent
                            body: the Independent Police Complaints Commission in England and Wales, the
                            Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland or the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.

                        <h3>Terrorism and extremism</h3>

                        <p>
                            The UK faces a range of terrorist threats. The most serious of these is from Al Qa’ida,
                            its affiliates and like-minded organisations. The UK also faces threats from other kind
                            of terrorism, such as Northern Ireland-related terrorism.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            All terrorist groups try to radicalise and recruit people to their cause. How, where and to what
                            extent they try to do so will vary. Evidence shows that these groups attract very low levels of
                            public support, but people who want to make their home in the UK should be aware of this threat.
                            It is important that all citizens feel safe. This includes feeling safe from all kinds of extremism
                            (vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values), including religious extremism and far-right extremism.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you think someone is trying to persuade you to join an extremist or terrorist cause,
                            you should notify your local police force.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="target5" id="t-5-6">The role of the courts</h3>

                        <h3>The judiciary</h3>

                        <p>
                            Judges (who are together called ‘the judiciary’) are responsible for interpreting the law and
                            ensuring that trials are conducted fairly. The government cannot interfere with this.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Sometimes the actions of the government are claimed to be illegal. If the judges agree,
                            then the government must either change its policies or ask Parliament to change the law.
                            If judges find that a public body is not respecting someone’s legal rights, they can
                            order that body to change its practices and/or pay compensation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Judges also make decisions in disputes between members of the public or organisations.
                            These might be about contracts, property or employment rights or after an accident.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Criminal courts</h3>

                        <p>
                            There are some differences between the court systems in
                            England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Magistrates’ and Justice of the Peace Courts</h3>

                        <p>
                            In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, most minor criminal cases are dealt with in a Magistrates’ Court.
                            In Scotland, minor criminal offences go to a Justice of the Peace Court.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Magistrates and Justices of the Peace (JPs) are members of the local community.
                            In England, Wales and Scotland they usually work unpaid and do not need legal qualifications.
                            They receive training to do the job and are supported by a legal adviser.
                            Magistrates decide the verdict in each case that comes before them and,
                            if the person is found guilty, the sentence that they are given.
                            In Northern Ireland, cases are heard by a District Judge or Deputy District Judge, who is legally qualified and paid.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Crown Courts and Sheriff Courts</h3>

                        <p>
                            In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, serious offences are tried in front of a judge and a jury in a Crown Court.
                            In Scotland, serious cases are heard in a Sheriff Court with either a sheriff or a sheriff with a jury.
                            The most serious cases in Scotland, such as murder, are heard at a High Court with a judge and jury.
                            A jury is made up of members of the public chosen at random from the local electoral register.
                            In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a jury has 12 members, and in Scotland a jury has 15 members.
                            Everyone who is summoned to do jury service must do it unless they are not eligible (for example,
                            because they have a criminal conviction) or they provide a good reason to be excused, such as ill health.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The jury has to listen to the evidence presented at the trial and then decide a verdict of ‘guilty’
                            or ‘not guilty’ based of what they have heard. In Scotland, a third verdict of ‘not proven’ is also possible.
                            If the jury finds a defendant guilty, the judge decides the penalty.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Youth Courts</h3>

                        <p>
                            In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, if an accused person is aged 10 to 17, the case is normally heard in
                            a Youth Court in front of up to three specially trained magistrates or a District Judge. The most serious
                            cases will go the Crown Court. The parents or carers of the young person are expected to attend the hearing.
                            Members of the public are not allowed in Youth Courts, and the name or photographs of the accused young person
                            cannot be published in newspapers or used by the media.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Scotland a system called the Children’s Hearings System is used to deal with children and young people who have committed an offence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Northern Ireland has a system of youth conferencing to consider how a child should be dealt with when they have committed an offence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Old Bailey is probably the most famous criminal court in the world
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="highlight">Civil courts</h3>

                        <h3>County Courts</h3>

                        <p>
                            County Courts deal with a wide range of civil disputes. These include people trying to get back money that is owed to them,
                            cases involving personal injury, family matters, breaches of contract, and divorce. In Scotland, most of these matters are
                            dealt with in the Sheriff Court. More serious civil cases – for example, when a large amount of compensation is being
                            claimed – are dealt with in the High Court of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, they are dealt with
                            in the Court of Session in Edinburgh.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The small claims procedure</h3>

                        <p>
                            The small claims procedure is an informal way of helping people to settle minor disputes without spending a lot of time
                            and money using a lawyer. This procedure is used for claims of less than £10,000 in England and Wales and £3,000 in
                            Scotland and Northern Ireland. The hearing is held in front of a judge in an ordinary room, and people from both
                            sides of the dispute sit around a table. Small claims can also be issued online through
                            Money Claims Online (<a href="www.moneyclaim.gov.uk">www.moneyclaim.gov.uk</a>).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Solicitors are trained lawyers who give advice on legal matters, take action for their
                            clients and represent their clients in court.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are solicitors’ offices throughout the UK. It is important to find out which aspects of
                            law a solicitor specialises in and to check that they have the right experience to help you
                            with your case. Many advertise in local newspapers and in Yellow Pages.

                            Solicitors’ charges are usually based on how much time they spend of a case.
                            It is very important to find out at the start how much a case is likely to cost.

                        <p>
                            Britain has a long history of respecting an individual’s rights and ensuring essential freedoms.
                            These rights have their roots in Magna Carta, the Habeas Corpus Act and the Bill of Rights of
                            1689, and they have developed over a period of time. British diplomats and lawyers had an
                            important role in drafting the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
                            The UK was one of the first countries to sign the Convention in 1950.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some of the principles included in the European Convention of Human Rights are:

                            The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporated the European Convention of Human Rights into UK law. The government,
                            public bodies and the courts must follow the principles of the Convention.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Equal opportunities</h3>

                        <p>
                            UK laws ensure that people are not treated unfairly in any area of life or work because of their age,
                            disability, sex, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sexuality or marital status.

                        <p>
                            In the UK, brutality and violence in the home is a serious crime.
                            Anyone who is violent towards their partner – whether they are a man or
                            a woman, married or living together – can be prosecuted. Any man who forces a
                            woman to have sex, including a woman’s husband, can be charged with rape.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is important for anyone facing domestic violence to get help as soon as possible.
                            A solicitor or the Citizens Advice Bureau can explain the available options.
                            In some areas there are safe places to go and stay in, called refuges or shelters.
                            There are emergency telephone numbers in the helpline section at the front of
                            Yellow Pages, including, for women, the number of the nearest women’s centre.
                            You can also phone the 24-hour National Domestic Violence Freephone Helpline
                            on 0808 2000 247 at any time, or the police can help you find a safe place to stay.

                        <h3>Female genital mutilation</h3>

                        <p>
                            Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as cutting or female circumcision, is illegal
                            in the UK. Practicing FGM or taking a girl or woman abroad for FGM is a criminal offence.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Forced marriage</h3>

                        <p>
                            A marriage should be entered into with the full and free consent of both people involved.
                            Arranged marriages, where both parties agree to the marriage, are acceptable in the UK.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Forced marriage is where one or both parties do not or cannot give their consent to enter into the partnership.
                            Forcing another person to marry is a criminal offence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Forced Marriage Protection Orders were introduced in 2008 for England, Wales and Northern Ireland under
                            the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007. Court orders can be obtained to protect a person
                            from being forced into a marriage, or to protect a person in a forced marriage.
                            Similar Protection Orders were introduced in Scotland in November 2011.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A potential victim, or someone acting for them, can apply for an order.
                            Anyone found to have breached an order can be jailed for up to two years for contempt of court.

                            Money raised from income tax pays for government services such as roads, education, police and the armed forces.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For most people, the right amount of income tax is automatically taken from their income from employment
                            by their employer and paid directly to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the government department
                            that collects taxes. This system is called “Pay As You Earn” (PAYE).
                            If you are self-employed, you need to pay your own tax through a system called ‘self-assessment’,
                            which includes completing a tax return. Other people may also need to complete a tax return.
                            If HMRC sends you a tax return, it is important to completed and return the form as soon as
                            you have all the necessary information.

                        <h3>National Insurance</h3>

                        <p>
                            Almost everybody in the UK who is in paid work, including self-employed people,
                            must pay National Insurance Contributions. The money raised from National Insurance Contributions
                            is used to pay for state benefits and services such as the state retirement pension and the National Health Service (NHS).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Employees have their National Insurance Contributions deducted from their pay by their employer.
                            People who are self-employed need to pay National Insurance Contributions themselves.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Anyone who does not pay enough National Insurance Contributions will not be able to receive certain
                            contributory benefits such as Jobseeker’s Allowance or a full state retirement pension. Some workers,
                            such as part-time workers, may not qualify for statutory payments such as maternity pay if they do not earn enough.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Further guidance about National Insurance Contributions is available on HMRC’s website at

                        <h3>Getting a National Insurance number</h3>

                        <p>
                            A National Insurance number is a unique personal account number. It makes sure that the
                            National Insurance Contributions and tax you pay are properly recorded against your name.
                            All young people in the UK are sent a National Insurance number just before their 16th birthday.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A non-UK national living in the UK and looking for work, starting work or setting up as self-employed will
                            need a National Insurance number. However, you can start work without one. If you have permission to work
                            in the UK, you will need to telephone the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to arrange to get a
                            National Insurance number. You may be required to attend an interview. The DWP will advise you of the
                            appropriate application process and tell you which documents you will need to bring to an interview
                            if one is necessary. You will usually need documents that prove your identity and that you have
                            permission to work in the UK. A National Insurance number does not on its own prove to an employer
                            that you have the right to work in the UK.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the UK, you must be at least 17 years to drive a car or motor cycle and you must have a driving licence
                            to drive on public roads. To get a UK driving licence you must pass a driving test, which tests both your
                            knowledge and your practical skills. You need to be at least 16 years old to ride a moped, and there are
                            other age requirements and special tests for driving large vehicles.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Drivers can use their driving licence until they are 70 years old. After that, the licence is valid for three years at a time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Northern Ireland, a newly qualified driver must display an ‘R’ plate (for restricted driver) for one year
                            after passing the test.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If your driving licence if from a country in the European Union (EU), Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway, you can
                            drive in the UK for as long as your licence is valid. If you have a licence from any other country, you may use
                            it in the UK for up to 12 months. To continue driving after that, you must get a UK full driving licence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you are resident in the UK, your car or motor cycle must be registered at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).
                            You must pay an annual road tax and display the tax disc, which shows that the tax has been paid, on the windowscreen.
                            You must also have valid motor insurance. It is a serious criminal offence to drive without insurance.
                            If you vehicle is over three years old, you must take it to the Ministry of Transport (MOT) test every year.
                            It is an offense not to have a MOT certificate if your vehicle is more than three years old. You can find
                            out more about vehicle tax and MOT requirements from <a href="www.gov.uk">www.gov.uk</a>

                        <p>
                            Although Britain is one of the world’s most diverse societies, there is a set of shared
                            values and responsibilities that everyone can agree with. These values and responsibilities
                            that everyone can agree with. These values and responsibilities include:
                        </p>

                        <div class="informative">

                            <ul>

                                <li>To be aware of the rights of others and respect those rights</li>

                                    To treat everyone equally, regardless of sex, race, religion, age,
                                    disability, class or sexual orientation
                                </li>

                        <p>
                            Taking on these values and responsibilities will make it easier for you to become a full and active citizen.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Being a good neighbour</h3>

                        <p>
                            When you move into a new house or apartment, introduce yourself to the people who live near you.
                            Getting to know your neighbours can help you to become part of the community and make friends.
                            Your neighbours are also a good source of help – for example, they may be willing to feed your pets
                            if you are away, or offer advice on local shops and services.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can help prevent any problems and conflicts with your neighbours by respecting their privacy
                            and limiting how much noise you make. Also try to keep your garden tidy, and only put your refuse
                            bags and bins on the street or in communal areas if they are due to be collected.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Getting involved in local activities</h3>

                        <p>
                            Volunteering and helping your community are an important part of being a good citizen.
                            They enable you to integrate and get to know other people. It helps to make your community a
                            better place if residents support each other. It also helps you to fulfil your duties as a
                            citizen, such as behaving responsibly and helping others.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="target5" id="t-5-11">How you can support your community</h3>

                        <p>
                            There are a number of positive ways in which you can support your community and be a good citizen.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Jury service</h3>

                        <p>
                            As well as getting the right to vote, people on the electoral register are randomly selected to serve on a jury.
                            Anyone who is on the electoral register and is aged 18 to 70 can be asked to do this.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Helping in schools</h3>

                        <p>
                            If you have children, there are many ways in which you can help at their schools.
                            Parents can often help in classrooms, by supporting activities or listening to children read.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Many schools organise events to raise money for extra equipment or out-of school activities.
                            Activities might include book sales, toy sales or bringing food to sell.
                            You might have good ideas of your own for raising money.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Sometimes events are organised by parent-teacher associations (PTAs). Volunteering to help
                            with their events or joining the association is a way of doing something good for the school
                            and also making new friends in your local community. You can find out about these opportunities
                            from notices in the school or notes your children bring home.
                        </p>

                        <h3>School governors and school boards</h3>

                        <p>
                            School governors, or members of the school board in Scotland, are people from the local community who
                            wish to make a positive contribution to their children’s education. They must be aged 18 or over at
                            the date of their election or appointment. There is no upper age limit.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Governors and school boards have an important part to play in raising school standards. They have three key roles:
                        </p>

                        <div class="informative">

                            <ul>
                                <li>Setting the strategic direction of the school</li>
                                <li>Ensuring accountability</li>
                                <li>Monitoring and evaluating school performance.</li>
                            </ul>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            You can contact your local school to ask if they need a new governor or school board member.
                            In England, you can also apply online at the School Governors’ One-Stop Shop at <a href="www.sgoss.org.uk">www.sgoss.org.uk</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In England, parents and other community groups can apply to open a free school in their local area.
                            More information about this can be found on the Department for Education website at <a href="www.dfe.gov.uk">www.dfe.gov.uk</a>
                        </p>

                        <h3>Supporting political parties</h3>

                        <p>
                            Political parties welcome new members. Joining one is a way to demonstrate your support for
                            certain views and to get involved in the democratic process.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Political parties are particularly busy at election times. Members work hard to persuade people to vote
                            for their candidates – for instance, by handing out leaflets in the street or by knocking on people’s
                            doors and asking for their support. This is called ‘canvassing’. You don’t have to tell a canvasser
                            how you intend to vote if you don’t want to.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            British citizens can stand for office as a local councillor, a member of Parliament (or the devolved equivalents)
                            or a member of the European Parliament. This is an opportunity to become even more involved in the political
                            life of the UK. You may also be able to stand for office if you are an Irish citizen, an eligible Commonwealth
                            citizen or (except for standing to be an MP) a citizen of another EU country.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can find out more about joining a political party from the individual party websites.

                        <h3>Helping with local services</h3>

                        <p>
                            There are opportunities to volunteer with a wide range of local service providers,
                            including local hospitals and youth projects. Services often want to involve local
                            people in decisions about the way in which they work. Universities, housing associations,
                            museums and arts councils may advertise for people to serve as volunteers in their governing bodies.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can volunteer with the police, and become a special constable or a lay (non-police) representative.
                            You can also apply to become a magistrate. You will often find advertisements for vacancies in your local
                            newspaper or on local radio. You can also find out more about these sorts of roles at <a href="www.gov.uk">www.gov.uk</a>

                        <h3>Blood and organ donation</h3>

                        <p>
                            Donated blood is used by hospitals to help people with a wide range of injuries and illnesses.
                            Giving blood only takes about an hour to do. You can register to give blood at:

                            Many people in the UK are waiting for organ transplants. If you register to be an organ donor,
                            it can make it easier for your family to decide whether to donate your organs when you die.
                            You can register to be an organ donor at <a href="www.organdonation.nhs.uk">www.organdonation.nhs.uk</a>.
                            Living people can also donate a kidney.

                        <h3>Other ways to volunteer</h3>

                        <p>
                            Volunteering is working for good causes without payment. There are many benefits to volunteering,
                            such as meeting new people and helping make your community a better place. Some volunteer
                            activities will give you a chance to practise your English or develop work skills that
                            will help you find or improve your curriculum vitae (CV). Many people volunteer simply
                            because they want to help other people.

                            There are thousands of active charities and voluntary organizations in the UK.
                            They work to improve the lives of people, animals and the environment in many different ways.
                            They range from the British Red Cross, to small local charities working in particular areas.
                            They include charities working with older people (such as Age UK), with children (for example,
                            the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC)), and with the homeless
                            (for example, Crisis and Shelter). There are also medical research charities (for example, Cancer Research UK),
                            environmental charities (including the National Trust and Friends of the Earth) and charities working
                            with animals (such as the People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA)).

                            Volunteers are needed to help with their activities and to raise money. The charities often advertise in
                            local newspapers, and most have websites that include information about their opportunities.

                            help them to develop their skills. These include the National Citizen Service programme, which gives
                            16- and 17-year-olds the opportunity to enjoy outdoor activities, develop their skills and take part
                            in a community project. You can find out more about these opportunities as follows:

                        <p>
                            It is important to recycle as much of your waste as you can. Using recycled materials to make
                            new products uses less energy and means that we do not need to extract more raw materials from
                            the earth. It also means that less rubbish is created, so the amount being put into landfill is reduced.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can learn more about recycling and it benefits at <a href="www.recyclenow.com">www.recyclenow.com</a>. At this website you can also
                            find out what you can recycle at home and in the local area you live in England. This information
                            is available for Wales at <a href="www.wasteawarenesswales.org.uk">www.wasteawarenesswales.org.uk</a>, for
                            Scotland at <a href="www.recycleforscotland.com">www.recycleforscotland.com</a> and for
                            Northern Ireland from your local authority.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A good way to support your local community is to shop for products locally where you can.
                            This will help businesses and farmers in your area in Britain. It will also reduce your carbon footprint,
                            because the products you buy will not have had to travel as far.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Walking and using public transport to get around when you can is also a good way to protect the environment.
                            It means that you create less pollution that when you use a car.
                        </p>
